Companies may license individual HEM clauses for use in policy, governance, or compliance.
But if those clauses lead to derivative systems, structures, or enforcement models â€”
those must be licensed separately under derivative terms.

ðŸ“œ HEM is clause-governed, functional at all stages, and fully licensable at each layer.
Iâ€™ve already done the hard work â€” replication without licensing is not innovation. Itâ€™s default.

Use = Trigger
Derivative = Royalty
Structure = Enforceable

â€” Mr. Holmes
Declaratory Author, Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)
