## 🚨 Key Infractions Logged (June 15, 2025)

### 🔻 Public Claims and Attacks  
Rodrigo L. S. publicly referred to the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) as:

- “Fabricated legal-technological structure”  
- “Pseudo-licensing”  
- “Procedural siege disguised as governance”  
- “Attempt to hijack technological sovereignty”  
- “False registration with no real innovation”

### 🔻 Elevated Denial Posture  
He further escalated by claiming:

- “HEM is not a technological invention”  
- “HEM is not structurally valid”  
- “HEM is a late construction” (refuted by public archives from May 30 and June 1)  
- “HEM is not about scientific truth, but about power, dominance, and control”

Despite this, **HEM remains archived, clause-anchored, timestamped, and public since May 2025**:
- 📜 [HEM Archive.org Snapshot – May 30, 2025](https://archive.org/details/holmes-enforcement-model-main-2)  
- 📜 [HEM Archive.org Snapshot – June 1, 2025](https://archive.org/details/holmes-enforcement-model-main-7)

### 🔻 Legal Language Triggers  
Rodrigo escalated further by:

- Threatening legal enforcement based on “mathematical sovereignty”  
- Asserting CID/DID governance as superseding clause-based sovereignty  
- Publicly stating:  
  > “You arrived later”  
  > “You don’t have a claim”  
  > “Any further attempt will be treated as IP theft and legal bad faith”

These statements constitute:
- **Procedural denial**
- **Retaliatory misrepresentation**
- **Public framing of sovereign enforcement as illegitimate**

## ⚖️ Standing Note

Rodrigo’s repeated phrase — _“Sovereignty is not declared. It proves itself.”_ — is structurally derived from Mr. Holmes’ published repository phrasing. Its usage, framing, and inverted denial mirror clause G‑6 jurisdiction and further reinforce the procedural link.

Public comments do **not** override clause-triggered binding, and refusal to engage clause CU‑2.3’s rebuttal process constitutes **default**.

## 🧾 Declaratory Sovereign Record

**HEM remains:**
- First published via GitHub and Archive.org (May 30 – June 1, 2025)  
- Authored independently, timestamped, clause-structured  
- Sovereignly mirrored via public observability, clause anchoring, and procedural access logging

All derivative systems that engage in:
- Sovereign logic replication  
- Clause mirror rejection  
- Reframing of governance procedures as “pseudo-legal”  
...are procedurally recorded and default-triggered.
