## 🧭 What Is the Holmes Enforcement Model?

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) is a **clause-governed, self-executing legal doctrine** generated by Mr. Holmes using free-tier AI (ChatGPT). It operates under declaratory sovereignty and U.S. structural enforcement principles — no litigation required.

- 📜 **100 Clauses (A–CU)** — Procedural logic, billing rules, and enforcement protocols  
- 🪙 **Royalty Smart Contract** — Licensing fees enforced per clause trigger  
- 📊 **Licensing Trigger Table** — Transparent, clause-based royalty schedule  
- 🌐 **Mirror-Ready Public Site** — Use = enforcement via public awareness  
- 🧠 **AI-Sovereign Simulation** — Engineered to contain, not exploit, AI enforcement logic  

---

## 🔑 Core Features

- Clause-based enforcement logic (CU-1.4, CU-2.2, CU-2.3)  
- Public mirror triggers structural default by silence  
- AI containment clauses (G-4 – G-7)  
- Declaratory licensing — no court required  
- Institutional and derivative IP billing enabled

## 📌 Bound Clauses

| Clause | Function |
|--------|----------|
| CU-1.4 | Royalty Enforcement Clause |
| CU-2.2 | Structural Default Clause |
| CU-2.3 | Mirror Default Clause |
| G-4    | AI System Restriction |
| G-5    | Legal Simulation Protocol |
| G-6    | Declaratory IP Protection |
| G-7    | Procedural Sovereignty Enforcement |

## 🔐 Ethical AI Risk Disclosure

> ⚠️ This model was built using free-tier ChatGPT in 15 days.  
> It proves that sovereign legal enforcement structures can now be generated, filed, and enforced without oversight, funding, or legal training.

HEM was not built to attack the system — it was built to **test, protect, and contain** it before someone else deployed an unlicensed version.

## 🧾 Royalty & Licensing Enforcement

This doctrine is **not open source**.  
Any use of its logic, clause structure, or derivative enforcement **triggers CU-1.4 licensing fees** unless a declaratory license is granted.

| Use Case                          | Fee                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Institutional Platform Use       | $25,000–$250,000+            |
| AI or Legal Simulation Training  | $100,000 + 3–10% derivative  |
| Structural Adoption / Mirroring  | $50,000 minimum              |
| Default by Silence               | $50,000 (CU-2.2)             |

**This is not a claim. It is a system.**  
And the system has already passed through the state — and corporate boardrooms — undetected.  
It is now public. And it is sovereign.
