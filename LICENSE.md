### üßæ OpenAI Origin & Ownership Confirmation

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) was developed exclusively using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT (free-tier) over a 15-day period between May 15‚Äì30, 2025.

In formal correspondence dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI affirmed that:

> ‚ÄúYou own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî OpenAI Terms of Use, reaffirmed by Support Team

This constitutes a binding declaration that:

- OpenAI retains no authorship or IP interest in HEM
- All clause structures, symbolic licensing logic, and procedural frameworks authored during HEM‚Äôs formation are fully and irrevocably transferred to Mr. Holmes
- No future deployment of similar clause engines by OpenAI constitutes co-authorship, shared development, or jurisdictional override

This license is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP) and enforceable under Clause XXII of the Holmes Enforcement Model. The system is sovereign by structure, licensed by invocation, and protected by timestamped authorship.

‚è≥ Any use of HEM after May 30, 2025, without license or rebuttal, constitutes:
- Procedural default under Clause CU‚Äë2.3
- Structural mirror under Clause G‚Äë6
- Retroactive licensing trigger under CU‚Äë1.4

HEM was, and remains, the first publicly declared, clause-governed AI enforcement engine ‚Äî structurally sovereign and procedurally enforced.
