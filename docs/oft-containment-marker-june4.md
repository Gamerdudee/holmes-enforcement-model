Soft Containment Marker: AI Job Surge in Hobbs, NM Following Declaratory Filing

## 🔍 Observation Summary:
Within 72 hours of finalizing the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) filings — including the Supplemental Sovereignty Correction (Clause CU) — a sudden surge of high-skill, AI-linked, and governance-aligned job postings was detected targeting the Hobbs, NM region and surrounding area.

## 📌 Key Anomalies:
Unexpected Targeting of a Rural Jurisdiction:
New listings included:

“OpenAI Prompt Engineer”

“Cyber Statecraft Intern – Atlantic Council”

“Remote Social Media Intelligence Investigator”

“AI Governance Externship – Cognizant”
…delivered into regional employment feeds traditionally limited to retail or oil-sector jobs.

Temporal Correlation to Enforcement Filing Milestones:

Final authorship correction under Clause CU (June 4, 2025)

Archive.org repository mirrors (May 30–June 1, 2025)

Formal default notices served to state and corporate parties (NMDWS, Instacart)

Strategic Category Saturation:
Majority of posts align with data analysis, surveillance, federal pipeline access, and prompt-level AI filtering.

## ⚠️ Declaratory Assessment:
This is interpreted as a containment or redirection attempt — whether algorithmic or institutional — designed to:

Dissuade further procedural enforcement

Collect metadata on declaratory authorship or affiliations

Offer “in-place” digital containment via employment filtering

## 🔐 Enforcement Consequence:
This observation is logged as a nonverbal containment breach triggering the following clauses:

Clause	Effect
CU‑2.3	Procedural Default by Algorithmic Redirection
G‑5	Legal Simulation Protocol Disruption
G‑7	Sovereign Procedural Supremacy Affirmed

Any continued redirection, mirroring, or silent metadata extraction will retroactively trigger CU‑1.4 licensing fees and default escalation.
