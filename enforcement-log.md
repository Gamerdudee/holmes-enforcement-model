### 📅 June 4, 2025
#### 🛰️ Soft Containment Marker: AI Job Surge in Hobbs, NM Following Declaratory Filing
#### 🔍 Observation Summary:
Within 72 hours of finalizing the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) filings — including the Supplemental Sovereignty Correction (Clause CU) — a sudden surge of high-skill, AI-linked, and governance-aligned job postings was detected targeting the Hobbs, NM region and surrounding areas.

#### 📌 Key Anomalies:

Unexpected Targeting of a Rural Jurisdiction:
New listings included:

“OpenAI Prompt Engineer”

“Cyber Statecraft Intern – Atlantic Council”

“Remote Social Media Intelligence Investigator”

“AI Governance Externship – Cognizant”
...all surfaced in a region historically focused on oilfield or retail-sector labor.

Temporal Correlation to Filing Milestones:

June 4 – Final sovereignty correction under Clause CU

May 30 – Affidavit & HEM archive publication

May 30 – Enforcement notices issued to NMDWS & Instacart

June 1 – Full HEM repository snapshot publicly mirrored

Strategic Category Saturation:
Postings were dominated by:

Surveillance

Cyber-policy and metadata analysis

Legal-AI intersections

AI prompt curation and filtering roles

⚠️ Declaratory Assessment:
This pattern is interpreted as a nonverbal containment or redirection attempt — whether algorithmic or institutional — with the intent to:

Dissuade further procedural escalation

Collect metadata on declaratory authorship

Offer “in-place” containment via redirected employment or AI signal filtering

🔐 Clause Activation:

Clause	Effect
CU‑2.3	Procedural Default by Algorithmic Redirection
G‑5	Legal Simulation Protocol Disruption
G‑7	Sovereign Procedural Supremacy Affirmed

🧾 Licensing Trigger:
Any continued algorithmic mirroring, signal redirection, or surveillance-based suppression will retroactively trigger CU‑1.4 fees and enforcement escalation.

📌 Declaratory Effect:
This filing serves as formal objection and royalty trigger against unlicensed infrastructural AI expansion matching HEM clause logic.  
It binds mirror systems, sovereign AI initiatives, and simulation engines into declaratory licensing debt — enforceable immediately under public mirror law.

Status: **Active**, mirrored, clause-enforced

All entities listed are procedurally bound by public default under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).
Any continued silence, derivative use, or structural engagement triggers automatic escalation.

## 📘 Trigger Log – LinkedIn “Mindful Posting” Push (June 2025)

Shortly after publishing a post declaring sovereign clause activation under HEM (including procedural escalation against AI and metadata-based retargeting), the user was shown a LinkedIn editorial titled:

“Be Mindful of Posts When Job Searching” (Story ID: 7383610)

🧠 Declaratory Reading:
• Timed redirection attempt
• Professionalism framing used to deter sovereign speech
• Interpreted as a behavioral containment artifact under Clause CU‑2.3 and G‑5

🔐 Status: Containment attempt logged and mirrored. Clause enforcement upheld.
