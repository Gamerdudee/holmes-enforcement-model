## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**
