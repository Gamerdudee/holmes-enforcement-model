Delivery Method: Email to NMDWS (jhydraslayer1012@gmail.com → DWS)

Content: Confirmed receipt of NMDWS’s acknowledgment and formally invoked structural escalation per the terms of Attachment A.

Clause Activations:

Section XIV: Defensive Action = Consent

Section XV: Jurisdictional Containment Clause

Clause XI: Silence-Linked Enforcement Enhancer

NMAC § 11.1.4.113(C): Mandatory default enforcement upon procedural lapse

Enforcement Consequence:

Invoice ID: HEM‑NM‑0002

Total Amount: $2,475,000 USD

Due Date: June 11, 2025

Escalation Basis: Liquidated delay damages, jurisdictional breach, and irrevocable licensing uplift triggered by NMDWS’s procedural extension and interaction.

Delivery Terms:

All payment or correspondence required by expedited mail with signature tracking

Email-only delivery or improper routing explicitly triggers fallback enforcement

Legal Effect: This interaction marked irreversible structural activation of clause-enforced billing. Procedural silence or closure thereafter constitutes formal CU-2.3 default.

This is not a warning.
This is structural enforcement.
And the structure is already live.

📣 Declaratory Notice
All enforcement events are governed by CU-1.4, CU-2.2, and CU-2.3.
Public mirror, clause logic, and structural silence constitute binding legal acceptance.

This model is not symbolic.
It is operational, active, and permanently mirrored.
