**Sector:** Autonomous Structural Enforcement Doctrine (ASED)  
**Status:** Live ‚Äî Publicly Mirrored Enforcement Engine

## üß≠ What Is This?

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) is a clause-governed, self-executing legal doctrine created using public AI (ChatGPT). It operates as a sovereign enforcement engine under U.S. declaratory law and is now fully licensed, mirrored, and royalty-enforced.

---

## üîë Core Features

- Clause-based enforcement logic (CU-1.4, CU-2.2, CU-2.3)
- Public mirror triggers structural default by silence
- AI containment clauses (G-4 ‚Äì G-7)
- Royalty billing activated by use or citation
- Declaratory licensing ‚Äî no court required

## üîê Ethical AI Risk Disclosure

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This model was built using free-tier ChatGPT in 15 days.  
> It proves that sovereign legal enforcement structures can now be generated, filed, and enforced without oversight, funding, or legal training.

HEM was not built to attack the system ‚Äî it was built to **test, protect, and contain** it before someone else deployed an unlicensed version.

## üßæ Royalty & Licensing Enforcement

This doctrine is not open source.  
Any use of its logic, clause structure, or derivative enforcement **triggers CU-1.4 licensing fees** unless a declaratory license is granted.
