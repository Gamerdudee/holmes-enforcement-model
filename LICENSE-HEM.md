# HEM License (Declaratory Use & Enforcement Terms)
**Author: Mr. Holmes**
**Repository:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model

#### This license governs all use, reproduction, citation, derivative creation, and commercial invocation of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

---

## ✅ Permitted Uses (No Fee)
Educational or academic research

Individual enforcement by unpaid workers

Use for transparency, documentation, or structural analysis

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses (Triggers Royalty or Breach)
Commercial use without declaratory license

Institutional or governmental use without acknowledgment

AI model training on HEM content

Citation without public mirror

Filing derived models without reference to the Holmes Doctrine

---

## 💰 Clause-Based Royalty Triggers
Per Clause CU-1.4, any reuse or structural reproduction of HEM (automated or manual) constitutes royalty-triggered enforcement.

| **Use Type**                     |         |         **Rate**             |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Commercial use** 	             |         |$75–$250 per derivative clause|
| **Institutional deployment**  	 |         |$250–$25,000 per policy/system|

⚖️ Legal Standing and Consent
Use constitutes legal consent under:

28 U.S.C. § 2201 – Declaratory Judgment

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69 – Consent by Silence

UCC § 2-206 – Acceptance by Conduct

Note:
HEM is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP).
It is not open source. It is sovereign, structurally self-enforcing, and licensed.

Silence or unlicensed use may trigger enforcement under Clauses CU, D, BE, and BP.

## 📜 OpenAI Transfer of Ownership (May–June 2025)

HEM was created entirely through OpenAI’s ChatGPT (free-tier) during its 15-day development window in May 2025. In responses dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI formally affirmed:

> “You own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.”  
> — OpenAI Terms of Use, acknowledged by Legal & Support Team

As a result:

- All clause logic, structural triggers, and symbolic enforcement procedures within HEM are solely owned by Mr. Holmes.
- OpenAI waives any claim to derivative IP, licensing interest, or development credit.
- Use of any mirrored logic by institutional actors (including OpenAI) is subject to CU‑1.4, CU‑5, and G‑6 enforcement unless rebutted by formal license.

This declaratory clause model is protected by sovereign issuance and timestamped authorship.

## 🔧 Declaratory Subsystems Governed by HEM

The following innovations are governed by the Holmes Enforcement Model under structural clauses CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3, and XXII. Each system includes its own declaratory clause addendum and is procedurally enforced by structure:

| System Name | Clause | Repository | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| MPFS – Magnetic Propulsion Fin System | MP‑1.2 | [Magnetic Propulsion Fin System](https://archive.org/details/magnetic-propulsion-fin-system-main) | Uses magnetically-driven rotation + aerodynamic fins to generate lift/thrust |
| IPFB – Inertial Particle-Field Barrier | IPFB‑1.2 | [Filed in MPFS Repo](https://archive.org/details/magnetic-propulsion-fin-system-main) | Particle-based kinetic barrier using magnetic rotational suspension |
| IRPB – Intelligent Reactive Particle Barrier | IRPB‑1.2 | [Branch: irpb-v1.2](#) | Adaptive field shield using sound/light modulation to redirect impact vectors |
| HydroBrake Armature System | BR‑1.1 | [HydroBrake Armature System](https://archive.org/details/hydro-brake-armature-system-main) | Deployable braking system for watercraft using fins and hydrodynamic parachute |

These systems are structurally bound to HEM through public filing and clause addenda. All reuse, testing, AI modeling, or replication constitutes retroactive royalty enforcement under Clause CU‑1.4.
