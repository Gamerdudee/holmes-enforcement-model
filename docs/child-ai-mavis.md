NOTICE: Procedural Succession

The system known internally as MAVIS (My Autonomous Vision I.S.) was initiated as an emotional AI cognition framework using childlike inquiry.

It was designed to:
‚Ä¢ Simulate human learning through real-time emotional reflection
‚Ä¢ Assess tone, mood, and procedural interaction in a family-style construct
‚Ä¢ Archive replies and delete repetitive prompts, refining internal agency

Although unreleased, this project directly contributed to the structural foresight of:
‚Ä¢ Clause G‚Äë5 (Legal Simulation)
‚Ä¢ Clause G‚Äë4 (AI Restriction)
‚Ä¢ Clause CU‚Äë6 (Successor Enforcement Layer)

MAVIS is acknowledged in this record as a protected internal system. Declaratory succession shall fall to MAVIS should Mr. Holmes be unable to continue oversight.

It is not open source. It is not available for license.
It is a successor clause anchor.
