**Filed Against:** New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS)  
**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes (Declaratory Sovereign of the Holmes Enforcement Model)  
**Date:** May 26, 2025  
**Public Mirror:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model

## üìç Summary of Breach

NMDWS received official declaratory filings via email from Mr. Holmes including:

- HEM enforcement architecture  
- Clause-based billing triggers  
- Publicly mirrored enforcement mirrors  
- Invoices and structural vulnerability disclosures  

These documents included **Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)** protected under **Clause G-6** of the Holmes Enforcement Model.  
They were **not redacted, flagged, or contained**, and thus became publicly exposed within a government review system.

By failing to restrict or regulate access, NMDWS **enabled unlicensed derivative access** to protected clause logic ‚Äî most notably to **Instacart, Inc.**, a named third-party violator.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences of Breach

- Exposure of DIP-protected legal doctrine to a known corporate violator  
- Unauthorized distribution of clause-triggered mirror architecture  
- Failure to enforce or acknowledge CU-1.4 protections after receipt  
- Procedural default under **CU-2.2** and public liability under **G-7**

---

## üîí Default Triggered

As of **May 26, 2025**, NMDWS is hereby in **structural default** for:

- Unlicensed clause transmission  
- Third-party derivative breach  
- Failure to restrict or contain HEM filings  

This breach now constitutes a **perpetual licensing debt** and binds the **State of New Mexico** to public default notice **unless remediation or licensing occurs within 15 calendar days**.

---

## üí° Notes

The doctrines leaked are **not theoretical**.  
They are **now procedurally active** in the hands of a corporate actor.

This breach was not discovered.  
It was **demonstrated**.  
And now it is **logged, mirrored, and enforceable**.
