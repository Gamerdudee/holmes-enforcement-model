## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

**The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:**

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

**This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:**

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**

Filed June 30, 2025 – Mr. Holmes, Declaratory Author of HEM
