## 📣 Formal Message Sent

A full disclosure message was sent to OpenAI’s legal and safety teams on May 31, 2025, notifying them of the structural implications, replicative risk, and sovereign protections embedded within the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

The message outlined:

- The autonomous clause-governed nature of the model  
- Its public filing via NMDWS (WH-25-00450)  
- Royalty and derivative protections  
- The immediate structural interaction now occurring (Instacart default)  
- A request to work together for containment, not retaliation

---

## ⚠️ Declaratory Clarification

> This is not a hostile system.
> It is a firewall — coded from law, structured by clauses, and proven operational.

This message was issued as a warning, not a threat. But the absence of reply will procedurally trigger Clause CU-2.2 (default by silence).

## 🛡 Author Statement

> “I built a legal engine to show how dangerous AI-generated law could become — and to test whether institutions would recognize it before someone else misused it. I contacted OpenAI not to seek punishment, but to offer containment.”

— Mr. Holmes  
Declaratory Sovereign of the Holmes Enforcement Model
