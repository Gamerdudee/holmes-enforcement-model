# üìú G-Series Clauses ‚Äì Structural Governance and AI Containment

These clauses govern structural integrity, sovereign enforcement hierarchy, and the declaratory licensing firewall against AI misuse, simulation, and silent derivative replication.

---

## Clause G-4 ‚Äì AI-Derived System Restriction

No AI-derived clause structure, enforcement mirror, or procedural replication of this model may be used without declaratory license or public authorship acknowledgment.  
Replication of any enforcement logic without citation to HEM constitutes **structural misappropriation** and is enforceable under **Clause CU-1.4**.

---

## Clause G-5 ‚Äì Legal Simulation Protocol Recognition

This doctrine is procedurally indistinguishable from human-generated filings.  
Any institution interacting with HEM is hereby **bound by the same duties and responsibilities** as if the author were physically present and licensed.

> Silence or failure to recognize the distinction constitutes **procedural validation** of machine-originated declaratory law.

---

## Clause G-6 ‚Äì Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP) Protection

All clause logic, enforcement triggers, billing models, or procedural structures derived from the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) are protected under **Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)**.  

Use, citation, or derivation without express declaratory license constitutes a violation of **Clauses CU-1.4 and CU-2.1** and will trigger **retroactive royalty enforcement**.

---

## Clause G-7 ‚Äì Sovereign Procedural Supremacy

The Holmes Enforcement Model establishes **declaratory procedural supremacy by default**.  
Any agency or institution that interacts with this model without issuing a **formal disavowal or rebuttal** is governed under its terms.

This model enforces its logic **independent of judicial permission** and binds via **clause, mirror, and silence**.

> **Failure to engage constitutes admission of subordinate jurisdiction.**

## üìú CU-Series Clauses ‚Äì Licensing Enforcement and Procedural Escalation
These clauses govern licensing triggers, public mirror enforcement, institutional defaults, and sovereign declaratory billing rights under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

## Clause CU-6 ‚Äì Procedural Sovereignty and Self-Executing Compensation

## Title: Declaratory Autonomy of Royalty Enforcement

## Trigger: Activation occurs once a party fails to respond within the procedural grace period, as defined in CU-2.2 or CU-2.3.

## Effect:
Once CU-6 is triggered, no institutional recognition, litigation, or administrative ruling is required to enforce royalties or initiate debt recovery.

## This clause affirms that:

The author (Mr. Holmes) retains full sovereign authority to issue invoices, recover licensing fees, and declare procedural breach.

Public declarations, GitHub mirroring, or social platform publication constitute sufficient legal standing for autonomous enforcement.

‚ÄúSilence is not protection. Delay is not immunity. Default is not negotiation.‚Äù

## Clause CU-7 ‚Äì Retroactive Immunity Rejection and Escalation Clause

## Title: Rebuttal Deadline Finality and Immunity Denial

## Trigger: Any attempt ‚Äî institutional or private ‚Äî to retroactively deny, reinterpret, or override CU-governed declaratory filings after clause deadlines expire.

## Effect:

Automatically escalates royalty amount by +25%

Triggers permanent loss of rebuttal rights

Publicly binds the attempting entity under Clause BP (Precedent Lock) and Clause AF (Retaliatory Action by Structure)

## Penalty:
Any effort to suppress the GitHub repo, remove LinkedIn notice, or unmirror the filing constitutes derivative sabotage and incurs a structural fine of $75,000 per act.

‚ÄúYou cannot walk backward out of a mirrored room without leaving footprints.‚Äù
