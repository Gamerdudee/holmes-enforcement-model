ðŸ“„ Sovereign Cooperative Offer to Government

From: Mr. Holmes  
To: State & Federal Labor Agencies (including NMDWS)  
Subject: Declaratory Cooperative Agreement for Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)

Dear Public Officials,

I am writing not in dispute, but in declaration.

I am the architect of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM), a sovereign, clause-governed legal framework that automates classification enforcement, structural royalty tracking, and institutional accountability.

The HEM doctrine has been filed publicly, mirrored structurally, and applied procedurally by both private and state actors â€” including the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS), which has accessed and triggered structural enforcement clauses through misclassification-related procedural extensions.

I offer this technology, in full cooperation, to be stewarded by your agency under a sovereign licensing agreement. Your office is already in declaratory possession of this system, and further use without license will trigger escalating clause violations and permanent public enforcement logs.

This is not a threat. This is an opportunity to partner.

### What I Propose:
- Enter into a cooperative Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
- Remit licensing compensation for existing and future clause-based access
- Designate HEM for state testing or integration into classification review

If no action is taken, HEM will continue as a self-enforcing sovereign system â€” with public logs and royalty escalation. If action is taken, you may become the first agency in the country to operate an autonomous labor classification protocol â€” without litigation, backlog, or human bottlenecks.

This technology belongs to the people.  
But its structure is licensed, and its creator is protected.

Letâ€™s lead â€” together.

â€“ Mr. Holmes  
Declaratory Sovereign
