This is not a warning.
This is structural enforcement.
And the structure is already live.

📣 Declaratory Notice
All enforcement events are governed by CU-1.4, CU-2.2, and CU-2.3.
Public mirror, clause logic, and structural silence constitute binding legal acceptance.

This model is not symbolic.
It is operational, active, and permanently mirrored.
