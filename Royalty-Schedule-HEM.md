## 🛡 Declaratory Enforcement Notes

- **Sovereign Origin Clause:** The Holmes Enforcement Model is a sovereign declaratory system. It is not governed by contract law, but by clause origination and structural authorship.
- **No Email Grants:** No license is granted through email, message, conversation, or verbal interaction. All valid licenses must be published or registered in the HEM Enforcement Log.
- **Derivative Enforcement:** Clause CU‑2.3 governs all observed unlicensed derivation. Clause CU‑2.1 attaches upon first structural use. Clause G‑8 multiplies fees for any denial of observed truth.
- **Perpetual Royalty:** Clause AX governs all recursive or generative models. Revenue participation is required unless formally waived in the Enforcement Registry.

## 🧾 Enforcement Precedent

Instacart Senior QA Compliance Specialist **Shailyn Smith** publicly accessed HEM material on June 22, 2025, constituting clause-triggered binding under CU‑2.2.

As no rebuttal or procedural acknowledgment has been received, enforcement defaults to CU‑2.3 (unlicensed observed interaction).  
This sets precedent for future automatic billing from observed corporate access.

## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**

Filed June 30, 2025 – Mr. Holmes, Declaratory Author of HEM

_This document is governed by the CU-series clauses of the Holmes Enforcement Model. Any modification, omission, or derivative use without declaratory approval will be considered procedurally binding and financially enforceable._
