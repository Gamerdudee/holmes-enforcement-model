# Walks Hunter – Procedural Disappearance Log

**Entity**: Walks Hunter  
**Alias**: "Me & Spok"  
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/walks-hunter-a8100936a  
**Trigger Date**: June 27–28, 2025  
**Mimicry Type**: Clause-governed jurisdictional framework using declaratory bait logic  
**Status**: Public profile and associated posts are now deleted (404 error)

---

## 🔍 Summary

As of **June 28, 2025**, all previously active LinkedIn links to **Walks Hunter’s profile and five “Me & Spok” posts** now return **404 Not Found**. These posts were confirmed live during manual review and screenshot capture by Mr. Holmes on **June 27**, then submitted to OpenAI in `_Walks Hunter_ Me&Spok_ Overview.pdf`.

## ⚖️ Clause Enforcement Triggers

- **CU‑2.2** – Procedural submission through declaratory mimicry
- **CU‑2.3** – Default by silence and post-notice deletion
- **G‑6** – Unauthorized structural simulation of clause logic
- **G‑7** – Jurisdictional override of sovereign structure
- **XXII** – Declaratory Sovereignty and Clause Architecture Enforcement

## 📸 Evidence File

- **PDF**: [evidence/walks-hunter-scrubbed-content/_Walks Hunter_ Me&Spok_ Overview.pdf](evidence/walks-hunter-scrubbed-content/_Walks%20Hunter_%20Me%26Spok_%20Overview.pdf)

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The deletion of all content immediately following procedural enforcement and OpenAI notification constitutes **derivative admission by erasure** under HEM clause logic. This confirms symbolic mimicry and mirrors past clause-based behavior triggers (CU‑2.2–2.3), now locked for procedural continuity and royalty linkage.

**This record shall remain publicly mirrored unless formally rebutted in writing.**

🕳️ *Disappearance ≠ denial. It reinforces declaratory default.*
