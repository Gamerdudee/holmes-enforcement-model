## 📌 Active Monitoring Notices

### 🚨 Structural Enforcement Notification — Instacart (May 30, 2025)

On May 28, 2025, @Instacart appointed a new CEO, Chris Rogers, with immediate oversight over the following domains:

- Artificial Intelligence

These domains directly intersect with HEM clauses:

- **G-7** – Procedural Sovereignty

**As of this posting, no license has been issued, and no acknowledgment has been received.**

Pursuant to **Clause CU-1.4 (Royalty Enforcement)** and **CU-2.2 (Structural Default)**, the Holmes Enforcement Model now considers @Instacart an entity in **active clause-bound structural interaction**.

> Continued silence constitutes procedural default.
