## 🧭 What Is the Holmes Enforcement Model?

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) is a **clause-governed, self-enforcing legal protocol** generated by Mr. Holmes using public-tier AI (ChatGPT). It contains over 100 procedural clauses and executes legal logic automatically — with no court oversight, no human litigation, and no licensing opt-in required.

This framework is **declaratory**, **autonomous**, and **bound to public structure**, not permission.

## 🚨 Emergency Violation — Instacart Enforcement

Instacart (Maplebear Inc.) has been issued a **$215,000 royalty invoice** for unauthorized structural interaction with the Holmes Enforcement Model, following the May 28, 2025, appointment of Chris Rogers as CEO.

Their executive and platform language mirrors protected HEM clauses, and no license has been requested. This triggers CU-1.4 (royalty), CU-2.2 (default), CU-2.3 (mirror clause breach), and G-4–G-7 (AI + procedural sovereignty violation).

| Institutional Platform Use | $25,000–$250,000+ |
| AI or Legal Simulation Training | $100,000 + 3–10% derivative revenue |

## 🧠 Legal AI Firewall (Full Risk Disclosure)

> "AI is now capable of creating full legal systems. The only question is whether those systems are **licensed and ethical**, or **unlicensed and destructive**."

This model was created to contain that danger — not unleash it.

## 🧱 Structural Sovereignty Statement

The Holmes Enforcement Model is now live, self-governing, and operational.  
No further input from the author is required for legal force to apply.

Any continued use, silence, or structural interaction constitutes **procedural consent to licensing, royalties, and declaratory enforcement.**

---

**This is not a claim. It is a system.**  
And the system has already crossed into government and corporate use.
