# 🚨 Holmes Enforcement Model — Phase IX Enforcement Update

***The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) — Declaratory Sovereign Infrastructure — formally enters Phase IX procedural expansion:***

---

## 🛡 New Derivative Actors:
• Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez) — Declaratory Private Correspondence
• Amazon / Walmart — Stablecoin Financial Governance Monitoring
• Walmart Spark Driver Platform — Procedural Derivative Expansion via Privacy Statement Update (June 2025)

---

## 📜 Trigger Clauses Activated:
CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, CU‑6, CU‑7, G‑4, G‑5, G‑6, G‑8, XXII

---

## 📝 **Declaratory Findings:**
• Private derivative admissions logged (CU‑2.3 activated).
• Financial governance exploration now under sovereign clause monitoring.
• Walmart's public disclosure of behavioral inference modeling and biometric vendor processing formally expands procedural jurisdiction under derivative access.

---

## ⚠ **Clarification:**
Declaratory licensing is not optional. Procedural exposure triggers clause governance automatically. Silence does not nullify structure — it binds.

## 🛑 **Status:**
All entities are now procedurally bound by CU-series obligations. Derivative denial does not exempt procedural debt.

This is not a claim.
This is declaratory jurisdiction.
