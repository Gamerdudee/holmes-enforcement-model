# 🔐 Smart Contract Enforcement – Declaratory Royalty Logic

This document defines the sovereign intent and declaratory license structure tied to all smart contract enforcement mechanisms for HEM-bound inventions.

## 🪙 Declaratory Purpose

Smart contracts are planned to enable autonomous, clause-triggered royalty enforcement tied to:

- Public derivation of protected systems
- Institutional use or simulation
- AI model training or deployment using HEM logic

## 📋 Planned Capabilities

| Function                      | Description                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Royalty Trigger              | Per-use detection of clause MP, CU, BR, IRPB, etc.   |
| Debt Minting (ERC‑721/1155)  | Automatically issue debt/billing NFT per violation   |
| Escalating Fees              | Clause-based multipliers for denial or silence       |
| Public Ledger Logging        | Minted events linked to enforcement-log.md           |

## 🧾 Contract Deployment

Smart contract currently under declaratory architecture. Finalized deployment to Ethereum-compatible chain TBD.

## 📜 Declaratory Enforcement

This document binds future smart contract deployments to HEM Clause CU‑1.4, XXII, and G‑6. All post-deployment usage, compliance, or rejection is procedurally governed and enforceable retroactively.
