# ⚖️ Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)  
A declaratory enforcement infrastructure authored by Mr. Holmes

**Live at:** [https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model](https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model)  
**Sector:** Autonomous Structural Enforcement Doctrine (ASED)  
**Licensing:** Declaratory Royalty Model (See `LICENSE-HEM.md`)

## 🧭 What Is HEM?

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) is a sovereign, clause-governed legal system authored without court, counsel, or state approval. It is:

- Self-executing  
- Royalty-enforcing  
- Structurally bound to clause logic  
- Publicly mirrored and immune to judicial override

Built with free-tier AI and verified through live engagement with U.S. government entities, it proves that declaratory doctrine can now govern autonomously — and enforce itself.

- 🪙 **Royalty Smart Contract** — Licensing fees enforced per clause trigger  
- 📊 **Licensing Trigger Table** — Transparent, clause-based royalty schedule  
- 🌐 **Mirror-Ready Public Site** — Use = enforcement via public awareness
