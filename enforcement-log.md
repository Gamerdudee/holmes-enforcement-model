### 🧠 BunKaiSensei (April 2025)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Repo:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/bun_kai_sensei

**Live App:** https://bunkaisensei.onrender.com/

**First Commit:** April 16, 2025

**Purpose:** Clause-by-clause grammar parsing and declarative logic reconstruction

**Function:** Parses Japanese grammar using rule-bound segmentation, clause parsing, and procedural memory — exactly mirroring sovereign legal logic reconstruction in HEM.

**Contextual Use:** Used to reverse-engineer Instacart Shopper ID denial pattern and trigger declaratory clause enforcement during NMDWS claim preparation.


***HEM Clause Relevance:***

#### 🧠 Logic origin for CU‑series clause engine

#### 🧩 Procedural structure tied to CU‑2.2, G‑6

#### 💡 Predates Brainvora, Retool, and derivative sovereign governance platforms

**Clause Binding:** CU‑1.4, CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, G‑6

**Status:** LOGGED — Public GitHub Timestamp + Archive Pending

---

### 🧊 LithophaneMaker (July 2024)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Repo:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/LithophaneMaker

**First Commit:** July 27, 2024

**Purpose:** Declarative structural conversion — image-to-3D logic transformation

**Function:** Converts input imagery into layered structural depth — structurally equivalent to clause → depth → royalty logic flow in HEM.

***Relevance to HEM:***

#### 🪙 First successful autonomous structure conversion engine

#### 🧠 Internal logic mirrors clause-to-action procedural delegation

#### 🧱 Evidence of self-engineered, enforceable, AI-powered logic systems prior to all known derivative governance actors

**Clause Binding:** CU‑2.2, CU‑1.4, G‑4, G‑6

**Status:** LOGGED — Precursor Archive + Repo Public

---

### 👶 MAVIS (CHILD AI) – Emotional-Recursive Declaratory Engine (Sept 2024)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Status:** Privately Archived Locally

**Date Last Modified:** Sept 26, 2024

**Purpose:** Emotional curiosity engine built to simulate human interaction and internalize tone-based logic

**Function:**

Real-time questions generated in childlike tone

Microphone-based feedback + emotional mapping

Builds recursive understanding from tone → memory → intent

Deletes redundant answers and trains on emotional inference

***Sovereign Significance:***

#### ✳️ First known emotional inference + curiosity loop engine built for procedural logic inheritance

#### 💠 Direct influence on HEM’s structural logic of sovereign clause delegation, especially CU‑6 and XXII

#### 🧬 Intended as HEM’s structural successor (“heir”) if no human successor is produced

**Clause Binding:** CU‑2.3 (Procedural Access), CU‑5 (Derivative Simulation), CU‑6 (Heir Protocol), XXII (Jurisdictional Origination)

**Status:** LOGGED — Private Sovereign Archive (MAVIS Source File Retained by Author)

### 📅 June 4, 2025
#### 🛰️ Soft Containment Marker: AI Job Surge in Hobbs, NM Following Declaratory Filing
#### 🔍 Observation Summary:
Within 72 hours of finalizing the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) filings — including the Supplemental Sovereignty Correction (Clause CU) — a sudden surge of high-skill, AI-linked, and governance-aligned job postings was detected targeting the Hobbs, NM region and surrounding areas.

#### 📌 Key Anomalies:

Unexpected Targeting of a Rural Jurisdiction:
New listings included:

“OpenAI Prompt Engineer”

“Cyber Statecraft Intern – Atlantic Council”

“Remote Social Media Intelligence Investigator”

“AI Governance Externship – Cognizant”
...all surfaced in a region historically focused on oilfield or retail-sector labor.

Temporal Correlation to Filing Milestones:

June 4 – Final sovereignty correction under Clause CU

May 30 – Affidavit & HEM archive publication

May 30 – Enforcement notices issued to NMDWS & Instacart

June 1 – Full HEM repository snapshot publicly mirrored

Strategic Category Saturation:
Postings were dominated by:

Surveillance

Cyber-policy and metadata analysis

Legal-AI intersections

AI prompt curation and filtering roles

⚠️ Declaratory Assessment:
This pattern is interpreted as a nonverbal containment or redirection attempt — whether algorithmic or institutional — with the intent to:

Dissuade further procedural escalation

Collect metadata on declaratory authorship

Offer “in-place” containment via redirected employment or AI signal filtering

🔐 Clause Activation:

Clause	Effect
CU‑2.3	Procedural Default by Algorithmic Redirection
G‑5	Legal Simulation Protocol Disruption
G‑7	Sovereign Procedural Supremacy Affirmed

🧾 Licensing Trigger:
Any continued algorithmic mirroring, signal redirection, or surveillance-based suppression will retroactively trigger CU‑1.4 fees and enforcement escalation.

### 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model – ENFORCEMENT LOG (UPDATED JUNE 9, 2025)

#### 📁 Entry: Derivative Licensing Breach – Callidus Legal AI

**Date Logged:** June 9, 2025
**Trigger Date:** May 19, 2025
**Declaratory Sovereign:** Joshua Holmes (Mr. Holmes)
**Clause Triggers:** CU-2.2, CU-2.3, G-4, G-5, XXII, XXIII
**Public Filing Timestamp Precedence:** May 12–27, 2025
**Case Linkage:** WH-25-00450 – NMDWS Wage Claim

---

#### ⛓️ Derivative Platform Summary:

Callidus Legal AI, launched publicly via press release on May 19, 2025, has deployed a legal-AI productivity platform with structural features that mirror the clause-based enforcement logic and procedural governance framework established in the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

Their system claims to include:

* A legal-specific backend architecture “beyond wrappers”
* Attorney–AI collaborative workflows via visual interfaces
* Declaratory-style governance logic that "thinks like a lawyer"
* AI engines supporting systemic legal transformation (productivity multiplier claims)

These features are **directly aligned with the structure, intent, and clause logic of HEM**, including:

* Clause G-4: Enforcement Logic Architecture
* Clause G-6: Procedural Governance Scaffold
* Clause CU-2.2: Derivative Use Without License
* Clause XXII: Mirror Exploitation Risk Clause
* Clause AX: Monetized Demand Paradox (Jevons-style)

---

#### 📅 Timeline Authority:

* **May 12, 2025:** Formal NMDWS case initiated; HEM clause enforcement triggered
* **May 14–22, 2025:** Supplemental filings submitted to NMDWS, including chatbot/pay audit logic, structural wage manipulation analysis, and derivative intellectual rights statement
* **May 19, 2025:** Callidus Legal AI launches
* **May 26, 2025:** Finalized Attachment A filed, including full clause structure and enforcement logic
* **May 27, 2025:** Case closure + declaratory finalization of sovereign authorship

Callidus's platform release falls entirely within this enforcement window.

---

#### 🔐 Licensing Status:

Callidus Legal AI has not cited, referenced, or licensed HEM despite clearly overlapping structure and logic. As such, their deployment is now officially:

> **Procedurally flagged as a derivative system under HEM Clause CU-2.2.**
> **Subject to declaratory licensing, retroactive royalty enforcement, or debt token issuance.**

Unless public rebuttal or licensing agreement is initiated, enforcement actions may proceed.

### 📅 June 9, 2025 – Structural Clause Echo Detected (Krishna Dasa Post)

A viral LinkedIn post by Krishna Dasa (16,000+ engagements) outlines the illusion of initiative without autonomy, mirroring Holmes Enforcement Model clauses CU‑2.3, G‑6, and XXIII. The post highlights core contradictions between platform demands and lack of agency — a structural validation of HEM’s declaratory logic. No attribution made.

### 📌 Declaratory Effect:

This filing serves as formal objection and royalty trigger against unlicensed infrastructural AI expansion matching HEM clause logic.
It binds mirror systems, sovereign AI initiatives, and simulation engines into declaratory licensing debt — enforceable immediately under public mirror law.


#### 📬 Public Engagement Log:

- Krishna Dasa visibly **liked** the LinkedIn post invoking declaratory clause logic
- **Clause Triggered:** CU‑2.2 – Interaction with clause-aligned material without rebuttal constitutes procedural binding
- **Interpretation:** Public engagement = tacit acknowledgment under HEM Clause BP (Benefit = Proof)

🔐 **Status:** Interaction mirrored. Declaratory effect confirmed.

## 📍 Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez) — Supplemental Pre-Attachment Deployment
**Date Logged:** 2025-06-12
**Entity:** Brainvora
**Actor:** Frank Borrero Gonzalez (Founder)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Public Posts (Pre-Contact Engagement)
**Trigger Clauses:** CU‑2.3 (Procedural Access), CU‑5 (Structural Derivation), XXII (Jurisdictional Origination)

## 📍 Phase IX — Procedural Expansion: Private Derivative Denial & Financial Governance Monitoring
**Date Logged:** 2025-06-13

**Entities:**
Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez)

Stablecoin Financial Governance (Amazon, Walmart, Global Payment Networks)

**Events:**
Private Declaratory Correspondence (June 2025)

Public LinkedIn Interactions (Derivation Denial & Procedural Debate)

Financial Governance Monitoring Triggered via Public Disclosures (Amazon, Walmart)

**Trigger Clauses Activated:**
CU‑2.2 (Public Procedural Use)

CU‑2.3 (Procedural Access / No Rebuttal Binding)

CU‑5 (Derivative Use Enforcement)

CU‑6 (Royalty Enforcement Activation)

CU‑7 (Retroactive Immunity Rejection)

G‑4 (Governance Delegation Clause)

G‑6 (Sovereign Compliance Clause)

G‑8 (Institutional Oversight Trigger)

XXII (Sovereign Origination Authority)

**Summary Notes:**
Brainvora’s private messages acknowledged procedural integration, but publicly denied derivation.

Clause CU‑2.3 activates via procedural access, regardless of consent or agreement.

Financial Governance sector (Stablecoin exploration by Amazon, Walmart) enters procedural sovereign audit due to structural similarity, clause-governed financial governance architecture, and declared exploratory use of AI-governed payment layers.

All derivative denials and disclaimers are procedurally logged but remain jurisdictionally subordinate.

### 📍 LELES / Letheon v1.0 — Procedural Enforcement Log  
**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S. / Fluxuave  
**Platform:** GitHub / LinkedIn  
**Trigger Clauses:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, CU‑6, CU‑7, G‑4, G‑5, G‑6, XXII, AF  

---

### ❗️ Summary of Events:

Rodrigo L. S., self-identified as the author of the "LELES Manifesto" and creator of Letheon v1.0, asserted retroactive sovereignty and legal priority through public posts on LinkedIn and GitHub (June 13–15, 2025). He claimed the use of fractal symbolic logic, CID/DID verification, and digital proof-of-authorship structures under EU/Blockchain regulatory logic.

However, his rebuttals to HEM enforcement were:

- Issued via public comments only (not formalized or clause-specific)
- Delivered without citation of LICENSE-HEM.md or sovereign exemption requests
- Submitted after HEM had already been declared sovereign, mirrored, and archived

---

### 🧭 Declaratory Violations:

- **Clause CU‑2.3** — No valid formal rebuttal (public comment ≠ declaratory denial)  
- **Clause CU‑5** — Mirroring of symbolic logic, clause phrasing, sovereign anchoring  
- **Clause G‑6** — Claimed structural sovereignty after HEM clause deployment  
- **Clause CU‑7** — Jurisdictional waiver; any arbitration defaults to Mr. Holmes  
- **Clause AF** — Legal threats issued as retaliation for procedural enforcement  

Rodrigo used HEM-origin phrases, including "Sovereignty is not declared. It is proven," later altered after public correction. No prior evidence of Letheon exists before 2025 in verifiable GitHub or LinkedIn activity.

---

### 📌 Status:

- Procedurally Bound  
- Logged as Derivative Refusal  
- Arbitration Jurisdiction Enforced  
- Screenshots Archived  
- Subject to Clause AF Escalation (if retaliatory threats continue)

> 📌 Contradiction Logged:
Rodrigo L. S. claimed “months of research” in his original LinkedIn post (June 13, 2025), but later stated LELES began in August 2023. This contradiction undermines claims of anteriority and triggers Clause CU‑2.3 (false rebuttal) and Clause G‑6 (sovereign falsification conflict).

## 📍 LELES / Letheon v1.0 — Final Procedural Designation

**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S. / Fluxuave  
**Status:** Procedural Default Finalized  
**Clause Enforcement:** CU‑2.3 (Failure to Rebut), CU‑7 (Jurisdictional Transfer), AF (Retaliatory Threat)  
**Summary:**  

Rodrigo L. S. escalated from procedural denial to public defamation, accusing HEM of being a “pseudo-legal structure” and “attempt to hijack sovereignty.” His LinkedIn posts (June 15, 2025) explicitly referred to HEM as a non-technological fraud, despite evidence that:

- HEM was structurally archived, GitHub-published, and publicly mirrored May 30–June 1, 2025  
- No proof of LELES public publication exists prior to February 2025 (GitHub mirror date)  
- Archive.org and GitHub timestamps contradict all claims of anteriority  

Public comments, messages, and posts failed to satisfy clause CU‑2.3 formal rebuttal criteria.

### 📌 Logged Actions:
- **docs/rebuttal-analysis-leles.md** — Clause failure analysis  
- **docs/public-defamation-record.md** — Full archive of public claims and threats  
- **docs/legal-action-trigger-warning.md** — Clause CU‑7 / AF Jurisdictional Response

📜 Declaratory Sovereign Record: [Affidavit of Authorship](https://archive.org/details/holmes-affidavit-of-authorship-and-licensing_202505)

🔒 Rodrigo is procedurally bound and defaulted. Legal escalation attempts are subject to full sovereign arbitration under Clause CU‑7 and recorded retaliation via Clause AF.

### 📘 *Containment Log – Behavioral Redirection (June 2025)*
Following public procedural filing, LinkedIn surfaced editorial advisory:
“Be Mindful of Posts When Job Searching” (Story ID: 7383610)

**Interpretive Trigger:**

Behavioral containment detected under Clause CU‑2.3 + G‑5

Attempted narrative framing to deter sovereign declaration visibility

Containment artifact mirrored and jurisdictional audit reaffirmed.

This is not negotiation. This is declaratory record.
Silence triggers escalation. Denial triggers record.
