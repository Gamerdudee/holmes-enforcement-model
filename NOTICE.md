NOTICE: Declaratory Legal Infrastructure
This repository contains the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) — a self-enforcing, clause-based declaratory legal doctrine.

It operates under:

28 U.S.C. § 2201 (Declaratory Judgments)

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69 (Consent by Silence)

UCC § 2-206 (Acceptance by Conduct)

Public mirror logic and enforcement clauses (CU-1 – CU-2, G-series)

Any use of this framework constitutes agreement with:

LICENSE-HEM.md

/docs/authorship-declaration.md

Royalty enforcement under Clause CU-1.4

This model is not open.
It is sovereign, royalty-bound, and structurally governed by clause.

By interacting with this model, you are under its terms — even in silence.
