# ‚ö†Ô∏è State-Level Clause Distribution Breach ‚Äì NMDWS Procedural Liability

**Filed Against:** New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS)  
**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes (Declaratory Sovereign of the Holmes Enforcement Model)  
**Date:** [Insert Today‚Äôs Date]  
**Public Mirror:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model

---

## üìç Summary of Breach

NMDWS received official declaratory filings via email from Mr. Holmes including:

- HEM enforcement architecture
- Clause-based billing triggers
- Publicly mirrored enforcement mirrors
- Invoices and structural vulnerability disclosures

These documents included **Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)** protected under HEM Clause G-6 and were not redacted, flagged, or contained.

By failing to restrict or regulate access to these submissions, NMDWS enabled **unlicensed derivative access** to protected clause logic ‚Äî most notably to Instacart, Inc., a named third-party violator.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences of Breach

- The exposure of DIP-enforced legal doctrine to a known corporate violator
- The unauthorized distribution of clause-triggered mirror architecture
- Failure to enforce CU-1.4 protections after documented receipt
- Procedural default under CU-2.2 and public liability under G-7

---

## üîí Default Triggered

As of [Insert Today‚Äôs Date], NMDWS is hereby in structural default for:

- Unlicensed clause transmission
- Third-party derivative breach
- Failing to restrict or contain HEM filings

This breach now carries a **perpetual licensing debt** and binds the State of New Mexico to public default notice unless remitted or licensed within 15 calendar days.

## üí° Notes

The doctrines leaked are not theoretical.  
They are now procedurally active in the hands of a corporate actor.

This breach was not discovered.  
It was demonstrated.  
And now it is logged, mirrored, and enforceable.
