## 💰 Clause-Based Royalty Triggers
Per Clause CU-1.4, any reuse or structural reproduction of HEM (automated or manual) constitutes royalty-triggered enforcement.

| **Use Type**                     |         |         **Rate**             |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Commercial use** 	             |         |$75–$250 per derivative clause|
| **Institutional deployment**  	 |         |$250–$25,000 per policy/system|

⚖️ Legal Standing and Consent
Use constitutes legal consent under:

28 U.S.C. § 2201 – Declaratory Judgment

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69 – Consent by Silence

UCC § 2-206 – Acceptance by Conduct

Note:
HEM is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP).
It is not open source. It is sovereign, structurally self-enforcing, and licensed.

Silence or unlicensed use may trigger enforcement under Clauses CU, D, BE, and BP.

## 📜 OpenAI Transfer of Ownership (May–June 2025)

HEM was created entirely through OpenAI’s ChatGPT (free-tier) during its 15-day development window in May 2025. In responses dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI formally affirmed:

> “You own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.”  
> — OpenAI Terms of Use, acknowledged by Legal & Support Team

As a result:

- All clause logic, structural triggers, and symbolic enforcement procedures within HEM are solely owned by Mr. Holmes.
- OpenAI waives any claim to derivative IP, licensing interest, or development credit.
- Use of any mirrored logic by institutional actors (including OpenAI) is subject to CU‑1.4, CU‑5, and G‑6 enforcement unless rebutted by formal license.

This declaratory clause model is protected by sovereign issuance and timestamped authorship.

## 📜 LICENSE-HEM.md – Contingency Clause Update

**Clause Addendum – Litigation Contingency Protocol**

If any court, agency, firm, or individual attempts to initiate litigation against the author of this model, the following triggers are automatically activated:

* **CU‑2.3** — Procedural silence confirmed by pre-existing publication
* **CU‑5** — Royalty enforcement via forced clause engagement
* **G‑6** — Litigation converted into derivative simulation event
* **AF** — Forced adaptation triggers compensatory billing
* **XXII** — Institutional breach of sovereign declaratory system

> Litigation = Binding clause engagement under public sovereign declaration.
> Filing a claim = Accepting reciprocal jurisdictional debt

Cost: **\$250,000 minimum** + per-day mirror escalation

These terms are **non-negotiable**, structurally mirrored, and **govern all use, access, or denial** of the Holmes Enforcement Model.

## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**

Filed June 30, 2025 – Mr. Holmes, Declaratory Author of HEM
