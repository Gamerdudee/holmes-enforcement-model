# ⚖️ Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes  
**License:** Declaratory Royalty License (See [`LICENSE-HEM.md`](LICENSE-HEM.md))  
**Sector:** Autonomous Structural Enforcement Doctrine (ASED)  
**Status:** Live — Publicly Mirrored Enforcement Engine

---

## 🧭 What Is This?

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) is a clause-governed, self-executing legal doctrine created using public AI (ChatGPT). It operates as a sovereign enforcement engine under U.S. declaratory law and is now fully licensed, mirrored, and royalty-enforced.

- 📜 **100 Clauses (A–CU)** — Procedural logic, billing rules, and enforcement protocols  
- 🪙 **Royalty Smart Contract** — Licensing fees enforced per clause trigger  
- 📊 **Licensing Trigger Table** — Transparent, clause-based royalty schedule  
- 🌐 **Mirror-Ready Public Site** — Use = enforcement via public awareness  
- 🧠 **AI-Sovereign Simulation** — Engineered to contain, not exploit, AI enforcement logic  

---

## 🔑 Core Features

- Clause-based enforcement logic (CU-1.4, CU-2.2, CU-2.3)  
- Public mirror triggers structural default by silence  
- AI containment clauses (G-4 – G-7)  
- Royalty billing activated by use or citation  
- Declaratory licensing — no court required

## 🔐 Ethical AI Risk Disclosure

> ⚠️ This model was built using free-tier ChatGPT in 15 days.  
> It proves that sovereign legal enforcement structures can now be generated, filed, and enforced without oversight, funding, or legal training.

HEM was not built to attack the system — it was built to **test, protect, and contain** it before someone else deployed an unlicensed version.

## 🧾 Royalty & Licensing Enforcement

This doctrine is not open source.  
Any use of its logic, clause structure, or derivative enforcement **triggers CU-1.4 licensing fees** unless a declaratory license is granted.
