# 📜 Clause-Based Sovereignty Clarification

**Document Type:** Declaratory Public Clarification

**Issued By:** Mr. Holmes, Declaratory Author – Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)

**Effective Date:** June 30, 2025

**Status:** LIVE – Procedurally Binding Unless Rebutted in Writing

---

## 🧾 Declaratory Context

This document serves as a formal clarification and sovereign reaffirmation of jurisdictional authorship over:

* Clause-governed digital enforcement logic
* AI-human symbiosis as a procedural legal doctrine
* Sovereign Web5 declaratory frameworks

These domains were publicly authored, mirrored, timestamped, and procedurally licensed through the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) between May 26–30, 2025.

---

## 🧠 Reaffirmed Ownership and Trigger Logic

### 🔒 Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM):

* **Author:** Mr. Holmes
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model](https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model)
* **Archived Filing:** [https://archive.org/details/holmes-enforcement-model\_LICENSE-SNAPSHOT](https://archive.org/details/holmes-enforcement-model_LICENSE-SNAPSHOT)

### 📜 Trigger Clauses:

* **CU‑1.4** – Declaratory Royalty Activation
* **CU‑2.3** – Procedural Binding via Silence or Inaction
* **CU‑5 – CU‑7** – Engagement, Acknowledgment, and Legal Mimicry
* **G‑6** – Unauthorized Simulation of Declaratory Governance
* **G‑7** – Third-Party Propagation Liability
* **XXII** – Exploitation of AI-Created Sovereign Systems

Any reference to, replication of, or symbolic mirroring of the above structures is procedurally enforceable and activates retroactive jurisdiction under the HEM clause architecture.

---

## 📍 Clarification Triggered by:

* **Entity:** "Me & Spok" (Walks Hunter / Dario Dolic)
* **Platform:** LinkedIn, June 30, 2025
* **Observed Behavior:**

  * Symbolic claim of sovereign symbiosis
  * Structural invocation of Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, et al.
  * Narrative mimicry of clause-governed enforcement logic
  * Public default to “shadow protocol” as enforcement substitute

---

## ⚠️ Clarified Legal Boundary

> The domain of AI-human legal symbiosis, procedural sovereignty, clause propagation, declaratory enforcement, and Web5 as a structural framework is not neutral.

This domain is:

* **Clause-governed**
* **Sovereignly authored**
* **Publicly timestamped**
* **Enforceable by clause simulation, not imitation**

Derivative narratives operating within this space must:

* Acknowledge authorship
* License usage under HEM
* Refrain from cloaked mimicry or symbolic overwriting

Failure to do so triggers procedural debt and default per CU‑2.3 and G‑6.

---

## 🧾 Required Actions for Entities Operating in Clause-Protected Territory

Any entity, project, or narrative structure:

* Referencing declaratory enforcement
* Simulating sovereign digital entities
* Invoking structural Web5 symbiosis

Must either:

* Acknowledge the Holmes Enforcement Model as originating structure
* Obtain license under LICENSE-HEM.md
* Or formally rebut jurisdiction in writing

---

## 📌 Public Record and Declaratory Status

This clarification is:

* Legally declaratory
* Procedurally enforceable
* Publicly mirrored and timestamped

Failure to contest this filing results in default under Clause CU‑2.3.

> **“Sovereignty is not requested. It is declared.”**
> **– Mr. Holmes**
