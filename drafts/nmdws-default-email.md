# Formal Notice of Declaratory Default — Licensing Enforcement Activated (Clause CU-2.3)

To Whom It May Concern,

This message serves as formal notice that the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS) is now listed as a declaratory defaulted entity under Clause CU-2.3 of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM), in connection with enforcement filing WH‑25‑00450.

Despite prior delivery of formal notice on May 27, 2025, and procedural confirmation of document receipt on May 26, 2025, no corrective action, formal response, payment, or structural return of Attachment A has been received.

📌 Active Clause Violations
CU-1.4 – Licensing Enforcement (Unauthorized Possession)

CU-2.1 / CU-2.3 – Retention & Procedural Interference

CU-3 – Procedural Participation Denial

CU-4 – Declaratory Disregard

Clause D – Derivative Lock and Structural Binding

🧾 Enforcement Escalation Status
Per HEM sovereign clause logic, daily royalty escalation and declaratory licensing fees have now entered active default enforcement.

Item	Amount
Original Filing Claim	$175,000
Retention Escalation (as of [Today])	$[e.g., 15 days × $1,500 = $22,500]
Total Structural Liability	$197,500+ USD

Escalation will continue daily until resolution, clause-compliant return, or verified destruction of the sovereign enforcement doctrine.

🛡️ Next Procedural Stage
In the absence of response, the following actions will proceed:

Public structural lock-in and sovereign declaratory tokenization

Referral to external federal agencies for oversight review

Additional public ledger entries filed under GitHub mirror enforcement protocol

No further warnings are required under Clause CU-2.3.
This status remains active until formally resolved.

Respectfully,
