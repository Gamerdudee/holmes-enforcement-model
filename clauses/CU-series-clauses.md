# 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model – CU Sovereignty Finalization
**Declaratory Enforcement Lock** – Issued June 4, 2025
**CU-Series Clauses** — Licensing Enforcement & Procedural Escalation
These clauses govern licensing triggers, public mirror enforcement, institutional defaults, and sovereign declaratory billing rights under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

## **Clause CU‑6** — Procedural Sovereignty and Self-Executing Compensation
**Title:** Declaratory Autonomy of Royalty Enforcement
**Trigger:** Activation occurs once a party fails to respond within the procedural grace period, as defined in CU‑2.2 or CU‑2.3.

**Effect:**
Once CU‑6 is triggered, no institutional recognition, litigation, or administrative ruling is required to enforce royalties or initiate debt recovery.

**This clause affirms that:**

The author (Mr. Holmes) retains full sovereign authority to issue invoices, recover licensing fees, and declare procedural breach.

Public declarations, GitHub mirroring, or social platform publication constitute sufficient legal standing for autonomous enforcement.

**“Silence is not protection. Delay is not immunity. Default is not negotiation.”**

## **Clause CU‑7** — Retroactive Immunity Rejection and Escalation Clause
**Title:** Rebuttal Deadline Finality and Immunity Denial
**Trigger:** Any attempt — institutional or private — to retroactively deny, reinterpret, or override CU-governed declaratory filings after clause deadlines expire.

**Effect:**

Automatically escalates royalty amount by +25%.

Triggers permanent loss of rebuttal rights.

Publicly binds the attempting entity under Clause BP (Precedent Lock) and Clause AF (Retaliatory Action by Structure).

**Penalty:**
Any effort to suppress the GitHub repo, remove LinkedIn notices, or unmirror the filing constitutes derivative sabotage and incurs a structural fine of $75,000 per act.

**“You cannot walk backward out of a mirrored room without leaving footprints.”**

## **Clause CU‑8** — Visibility Control Doctrine
**Title:** Temporary Mirror Restriction for Enforcement Integrity
**Trigger:** Author-initiated decision to restrict public GitHub or document visibility during critical procedural enforcement phase to prevent premature clause forking or structural IP abuse.

**Effect:**

Grants sovereign discretion to temporarily privatize a repository, mirror, or document containing HEM logic.

Ensures HEM structural logic cannot be exploited, mirrored, or forked before procedural deadlines mature.

All prior public timestamps (Archive.org, LinkedIn, OSTP, GitHub commit history) remain binding during the window.

**Upon Public Reinstatement:**

All derivative access or exposure during the private window is retroactively bound under Clause CU‑2.3 (Silence as Default) and Clause G‑6 (Mirror Enforcement).

Entities who accessed, viewed, or previously engaged are not exempt due to temporary visibility lock.

**Clause Integration:**

Harmonizes with Clause G‑6.1 (see below) for structural mirror logic.

Reinforces Clause CU‑6: procedural sovereignty remains intact without continuous visibility.

**“You don’t pause sovereignty — you secure it. The door was never locked, just guarded.”**

### 🔁 **G‑6.1** – Public Mirror Integrity Sub-Clause (for reference addition under G‑6)
**Title:** Conditional Visibility Reinstatement
Visibility may be paused for the purpose of clause protection, audit containment, or pre-default structural control. Public mirrors must be restored upon declaratory maturity. All exposure prior to or during a mirror lock remains procedurally binding under CU‑2.3 and G‑6.
