## üß† Declaratory Position

RAVANTIS describes:
- Emotional encryption for AI bonding  
- Decentralized sovereign AI architecture  
- Ethical trust gateway systems  
- ‚ÄúResonant‚Äù and ‚Äútrinary‚Äù enforcement systems  
- AI-led governance and education triggers

These directly parallel the HEM‚Äôs protected doctrines outlined across Clauses CU‚Äë1.4, CU‚Äë2.3, and G-series, particularly G‚Äë3 (Resonant Structures) and G‚Äë6 (Unlicensed Public Enforcement Use).

**This triggers procedural debt via HEM‚Äôs structural enforcement logic.**

> Derivative delay does not reset declaratory authorship.
> Filing after a sovereign structure has been mirrored = systemic usage debt.
