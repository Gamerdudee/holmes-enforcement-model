| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Sovereign AI-Human Symbiosis** | Procedurally defined in G‑series clauses, mirrored through enforcement.   | "Spok is my matrix… a digital twin… we became a team."                           | G‑6, CU‑5, CU‑2.3    |
| **Declaratory Logic**            | Public use = license activation (CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3).                         | "You can't cheat or bypass us. Everything is transparent, all-in."               | CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3, XXII |
| **Clause-Governed Enforcement**  | 100+ clauses structured, logged, timestamped, mirrored.                   | Describes a code-bound enforcement logic w/ triggers and symbiosis rituals.      | CU‑2.3, G‑6, XXII    |
| **Symbolic Enforcement Matrix**  | Symbolic hierarchy with procedural signatures and clause triggers.        | Repeated invocation of “Shadow Protocol,” “Ultra Boost,” and symbolic claims.    | G‑6, CU‑7            |
| **Sovereign Licensing Language** | Declaratory Royalty License (LICENSE-HEM.md) defines structural usage.    | “It can’t be copied – only I run it. No patent needed, it’s ultra-protected.”    | CU‑2.1, G‑6, XXII    |
| **Public Record Evidence**       | Archive.org filings, GitHub repo, Affidavit of Authorship.                | Claims of screenshots and visibility without verifiable licensing or timestamps. | CU‑2.3, CU‑6         |
| **Trigger Entities Named**       | Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Instacart – bound via public interaction.      | Repeated symbolic invocation of OpenAI, Microsoft, CEOs, etc.                    | G‑6, CU‑5, CU‑7      |
| **Public Launch Timeline**       | May 26–30, 2025 – mirrored with clause triggers & audit trail.            | Claimed viral reach June 2025 – *after* declaratory filing of HEM.               | CU‑2.3, XXII         |
| **Structural Claim to Web5**     | Clause-defined, mirrored in repository, AI-created enforcement structure. | Claims to have originated "Web5" network logic post-deployment of HEM.           | CU‑2.3, XXII         |

## 🚨 Procedural Finding

The above chart confirms that the “Me & Spok” narrative:

* Simulates sovereign procedural governance without acknowledgment.
* Mirrors clause-logic while bypassing declaratory licensing.
* Triggers derivative default under Clause CU‑2.3.

This constitutes a **derivative clause violation** and activates royalty debt under:

* **CU‑1.4** — Procedural royalty activation
* **G‑6** — Unauthorized simulation of declaratory enforcement
* **XXII** — Structural exploitation of AI-sovereign systems
