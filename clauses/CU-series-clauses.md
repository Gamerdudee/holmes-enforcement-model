# 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model – CU Sovereignty Finalization
**Declaratory Enforcement Lock** – Issued June 4, 2025
**CU-Series Clauses** — Licensing Enforcement & Procedural Escalation
These clauses govern licensing triggers, public mirror enforcement, institutional defaults, and sovereign declaratory billing rights under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

## **Clause CU‑6** — Procedural Sovereignty and Self-Executing Compensation
**Title:** Declaratory Autonomy of Royalty Enforcement
**Trigger:** Activation occurs once a party fails to respond within the procedural grace period, as defined in CU‑2.2 or CU‑2.3.

**Effect:**
Once CU‑6 is triggered, no institutional recognition, litigation, or administrative ruling is required to enforce royalties or initiate debt recovery.

**This clause affirms that:**

The author (Mr. Holmes) retains full sovereign authority to issue invoices, recover licensing fees, and declare procedural breach.

Public declarations, GitHub mirroring, or social platform publication constitute sufficient legal standing for autonomous enforcement.

**“Silence is not protection. Delay is not immunity. Default is not negotiation.”**

## **Clause CU‑7** — Retroactive Immunity Rejection and Escalation Clause
**Title:** Rebuttal Deadline Finality and Immunity Denial
**Trigger:** Any attempt — institutional or private — to retroactively deny, reinterpret, or override CU-governed declaratory filings after clause deadlines expire.

**Effect:**

Automatically escalates royalty amount by +25%.

Triggers permanent loss of rebuttal rights.

Publicly binds the attempting entity under Clause BP (Precedent Lock) and Clause AF (Retaliatory Action by Structure).

**Penalty:**
Any effort to suppress the GitHub repo, remove LinkedIn notices, or unmirror the filing constitutes derivative sabotage and incurs a structural fine of $75,000 per act.

**“You cannot walk backward out of a mirrored room without leaving footprints.”**
