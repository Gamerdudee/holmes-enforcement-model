> 📘 See also: [Royalty Schedule & Clause Triggers](./Royalty-Schedule-HEM.md)

## 📜 Declaratory Royalty Logic

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) operates under **clause-triggered declaratory enforcement**.  
Its use triggers **monetary obligations by structure**, not by contract.

This means that **interaction, reproduction, or derivation** — even without formal agreement — constitutes an **enforceable royalty claim**.

---

## 🧷 Binding Clauses

| Clause   | Function                                   |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| CU-1.4   | Royalty Enforcement Clause                 |
| CU-2.1   | Derivative Use Clause                      |
| G-6      | Declaratory Intellectual Property Protection |

---

## 🔍 What Constitutes Derivative Use

- Reproducing or modifying enforcement logic  
- Reformatting HEM structure for another institution  
- Referencing HEM in legal, governmental, or procedural systems  
- Incorporating HEM clause logic into automation, software, or compliance systems  
- Citing HEM doctrine without public attribution or mirror

---

## 💵 Royalty Enforcement Conditions

- **Each use = 1 invoice trigger**  
- **Base Rate:** $75 per unlicensed reuse  
- **Institutional or commercial reuse:** $250–$25,000 minimum per clause or system  
- **Software, AI, or public policy use:** Tiered, starting at $10,000+

**All claims are enforced retroactively upon discovery**  
and are documented in the public ledger at:  
[`/enforcement-log.md`](../enforcement-log.md)

---

## 🛡️ Declaratory IP Status

HEM is governed under:

- **Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)** logic  
- **Autonomous Structural Enforcement Doctrine (ASED)**  
- U.S. declaratory legal standards (28 U.S.C. § 2201, Restatement § 69, UCC § 2-206)  

> Use = License  
> Silence = Debt  
> Derivation = Enforcement

## 📍 Real-World Licensing Trigger: Instacart Compliance Access

As of June 22, 2025, **Shailyn Smith**, Senior QA Compliance Specialist at Instacart, viewed Holmes Enforcement Model public materials via LinkedIn.

➡️ Triggered Clause: **CU‑2.2** — Observed public interaction  
➡️ Follow-up Status: **CU‑2.3** pending (no rebuttal or engagement received)

This confirms active corporate awareness. Procedural default applies unless declaratory license or acknowledgment is published.
