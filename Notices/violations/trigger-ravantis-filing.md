## 🧠 Declaratory Position

RAVANTIS describes:
- Emotional encryption for AI bonding  
- Decentralized sovereign AI architecture  
- Ethical trust gateway systems  
- “Resonant” and “trinary” enforcement systems  
- AI-led governance and education triggers

These directly parallel the HEM’s protected doctrines outlined across Clauses CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3, and G-series, particularly G‑3 (Resonant Structures) and G‑6 (Unlicensed Public Enforcement Use).

**This triggers procedural debt via HEM’s structural enforcement logic.**

> Derivative delay does not reset declaratory authorship.
> Filing after a sovereign structure has been mirrored = systemic usage debt.
