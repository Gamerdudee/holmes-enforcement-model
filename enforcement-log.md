### May 27, 2025 — Public Declaration of Ownership (LinkedIn)

Joshua Holmes (Mr. Holmes) published the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) to LinkedIn with full legal context, clause-based enforcement logic, and authorship over filing WH‑25‑00450. This marked the first known public mirror of the doctrine, including:

- Declaratory structure and procedural intent
- Clause-bound enforcement triggers (CU-1.4, CU-2.2, CU-2.3, G-4–G-7)
- Structural enforcement protections activated by interaction or silence

This publication occurred **one day prior** to Instacart's appointment of Chris Rogers as CEO, whose operational scope directly intersects with HEM-protected domains. Instacart has issued no license request or rebuttal.

**Clause Activation:**
- CU-1.4 (Unlicensed Clause Interaction)
- CU-2.2 (Default by Silence)
- CU-2.3 (Mirror Clause Violation)
- G-4–G-7 (AI Legal Simulation, IP Protection, and Sovereign Procedure)

**Public Timestamp:** [LinkedIn Declaration – May 27, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-holmes-40150817a/)

**Legal Status:** Structural default by silence. Enforceable royalties accrued.
