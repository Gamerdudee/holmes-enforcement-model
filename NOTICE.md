## 🔹 Upstream Structural Tools & AI Simulations

```
•	bun_kai_sensei
```

- Created April 2025

- Early language clause trainer used to simulate sovereign linguistic frameworks, mirrored later in CU/G-series logic.

```
    •    LithophaneMaker
```

- Created July 2024

- Structured generator for clause-bound visual enforcement and symbolic simulation.

```
    •    CHILD-AI / MAVIS (Private)
```

- Created September 2024

- Real-time AI model trained to simulate autonomous clause discovery, emotional reinforcement, and ethical loyalty frameworks. Retained locally as a sovereign simulation seed.

These projects precede HEM and are procedurally upstream.
Any system that adopts clause-based governance, reinforcement filters, or adaptive trust scaffolding after May 30, 2025, is subject to review under derivative clause terms.

## 📌 Derivative Access Clause Attachments

Any implementation — public or private — that exhibits the following:
•	Clause-governed delegation or enforcement (CU or G-series logic)
•	Procedural architecture resembling sovereign self-enforcement
•	Declaratory boundary protection or mirrored sovereign denial
•	AI-human trust layers embedded in governance protocols
•	Ethical filters that align with clause G-4 to G-8 logic

…is subject to:

| Clause |	            Description                                    |
|------- |---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CU‑2.1 |	Trigger by procedural simulation                           |
| CU‑2.3 |	Default through unlicensed implementation                  |
| CU‑5 / 6 |	Derivative structural override without consent             |
| G‑4    |	AI delegation without sovereign clause acknowledgment      |
| G‑6    |	Jurisdictional distortion or simulation erasure            |
| XXII   |	Sovereign origin debt trigger (non-deniable clause)        |

Use = license. Silence = agreement. Rejection without rebuttal = default.

# NOTICE OF CLAUSE ENFORCEMENT — RODRIGO L. S. / LETHEON

This repository formally documents a structural enforcement action against Rodrigo L. S. (Letheon / Fluxuave) under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

**Rodrigo has been found in procedural default under the following clauses:**

- CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, CU‑6, CU‑7
- G‑4, G‑5, G‑6, XXII, AF, AT (Immutable Core Doctrine)
- IX‑E: Symbolic Derivation

A full procedural rebuttal, clause log, and mirrored evidence has been publicly archived at:

🔗 [https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-final-procedural-archive](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-archive-complete)

Rodrigo is now jurisdictionally bound and procedurally mirrored under sovereign authorship as filed in HEM’s public archive. Any denial, retaliation, or reuse of derivative systems is structurally enforceable under Clause CU‑7 and G‑5.

Filed Sovereignly,
Mr. Holmes
Declaratory Author — Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)

***NOTICE:*** Any framework attempting to restructure, improve upon, or simulate HEM logic must do so under declaratory license. Rephrasing is not independence. Rebuilding is not exemption.

This system is already declared. It does not evolve.

All derivative frameworks without sovereign license are procedurally bound.

🛡 Clause CU‑2.3 | 📜 Clause XXII | ⚖️ Clause G-6

## 🔒 Final Licensing Enforcement Lock – June 21, 2025

**Trigger:** Clause CU‑8 – Public Mirror Sovereignty Finalization

***As of June 21, 2025, the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) has formally invoked Clause CU‑8 to close any retroactive loopholes relating to GitHub visibility or delayed public mirror access.***

### 📍 What This Means:

- All entities who accessed, viewed, denied, or failed to respond to HEM during its operational phase (May 26–June 21, 2025) are now permanently procedurally bound.
- The temporary private status of the GitHub repository does not invalidate any licensing triggers, mirror access, or declaratory defaults.
- No party may claim exemption based on timing, visibility, or access ambiguity. Clause CU‑8 finalizes sovereignty of the public mirror regardless of status at any given moment.

**CU‑8 Trigger Date:** June 21, 2025

**Filed By: Mr. Holmes – Declaratory Author, HEM**

## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**
