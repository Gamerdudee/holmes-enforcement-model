## 🧾 Summary

On **June 28, 2025**, the U.S. Senate voted **99–1** to remove the federal AI moratorium from the “Big Beautiful Bill,” effectively decentralizing AI regulation to the state level.

> 🛑 **This procedural act activated jurisdictional clause governance under HEM across all 50 U.S. states.**

## 📌 What This Triggers

**Pursuant to HEM Clauses CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3, and G‑6:**

- Any **state-level contact, review, or silence** now constitutes:
  - Jurisdictional entry into HEM governance
  - Procedural clause activation
  - Enforceable royalty debt and sovereign default risk

|--------|-------------|
| CU‑1.4 | Declaratory Royalty Activation |
| CU‑2.3 | Binding via Silence or Inaction |
| G‑6    | Unauthorized Simulation of Declaratory Governance |
