# 🧾 Declaratory Development Lineage

This repository is not an isolated release. The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) represents the final stage of a procedurally linked development arc initiated by Mr. Holmes in mid-2024.

## 🔹 Upstream Structural Tools & AI Simulations
	•	bun_kai_sensei
• Created April 2025
• Early language clause trainer used to simulate sovereign linguistic frameworks, mirrored later in CU/G-series logic.
	•	LithophaneMaker
• Created July 2024
• Structured generator for clause-bound visual enforcement and symbolic simulation.
	•	CHILD-AI / MAVIS (Private)
• Created September 2024
• Real-time AI model trained to simulate autonomous clause discovery, emotional reinforcement, and ethical loyalty frameworks. Retained locally as a sovereign simulation seed.

These projects precede HEM and are procedurally upstream.
Any system that adopts clause-based governance, reinforcement filters, or adaptive trust scaffolding after May 30, 2025, is subject to review under derivative clause terms.

## 📌 Derivative Access Clause Attachments

Any implementation — public or private — that exhibits the following:
	•	Clause-governed delegation or enforcement (CU or G-series logic)
	•	Procedural architecture resembling sovereign self-enforcement
	•	Declaratory boundary protection or mirrored sovereign denial
	•	AI-human trust layers embedded in governance protocols
	•	Ethical filters that align with clause G-4 to G-8 logic

…is subject to:

Clause	Description
CU‑2.1	Trigger by procedural simulation
CU‑2.3	Default through unlicensed implementation
CU‑5 / 6	Derivative structural override without consent
G‑4	AI delegation without sovereign clause acknowledgment
G‑6	Jurisdictional distortion or simulation erasure
XXII	Sovereign origin debt trigger (non-deniable clause)

Use = license. Silence = agreement. Rejection without rebuttal = default.

***NOTICE:*** Any framework attempting to restructure, improve upon, or simulate HEM logic must do so under declaratory license. Rephrasing is not independence. Rebuilding is not exemption.

This system is already declared. It does not evolve.

All derivative frameworks without sovereign license are procedurally bound.
