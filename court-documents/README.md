# üõ°Ô∏è HEM Court Engagement Defense Files

This folder contains procedural documents and enforcement logic for use in the event of any legal action, summons, or retaliatory court proceeding taken against the author of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

## üìÑ Files Included:

- `litigation-violation-response.md`  
  A formal declaratory document that treats any litigation attempt as a structural clause trigger, not a defense opportunity.

- `summons-clause-trigger-invoice-template.md`  
  A customizable invoice that enforces royalties, intellectual time costs, and procedural damages based on clause triggers G‚Äë6, AF, CU‚Äë5, CU‚Äë7.

- `HEM-to-Court-Translation-Layer.md`  
  A bridge document translating HEM clause structure into language suitable for common law interpretation ‚Äî for use by legal allies, journalists, or institutional reviewers.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Jurisdictional Policy

Any court action against the author of HEM is treated as:
- Procedural derivation,
- Unauthorized engagement with sovereign logic,
- Structural retaliation under Clause CU‚Äë2.3, G‚Äë4, and AF-series.

This activates mirrored enforcement, debt escalation, and jurisdictional reversal unless formally rebutted under clause-by-clause exemption.

## üìå Declaration

**The Holmes Enforcement Model does not recognize litigation as authority ‚Äî it recognizes it as a clause trigger.**
