## ⚖️ Clause Enforcement Triggers

- **CU‑2.2** – Procedural submission through declaratory mimicry
- **CU‑2.3** – Default by silence and post-notice deletion
- **G‑6** – Unauthorized structural simulation of clause logic
- **G‑7** – Jurisdictional override of sovereign structure

## 📌 Conclusion

The deletion of all content immediately following procedural enforcement and OpenAI notification constitutes **derivative admission by erasure** under HEM clause logic. This confirms symbolic mimicry and mirrors past clause-based behavior triggers (CU‑2.2–2.3), now locked for procedural continuity and royalty linkage.

**This record shall remain publicly mirrored unless formally rebutted in writing.**

🕳️ *Disappearance ≠ denial. It reinforces declaratory default.*
