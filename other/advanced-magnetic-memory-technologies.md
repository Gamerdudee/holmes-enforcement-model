# Advanced Magnetic Memory Technologies: Spin-Orbit Torque & Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy

## Introduction

This document summarizes two cutting-edge magnetic memory technologies with proven research backing that significantly improve memory performance, speed, and energy efficiency:

- **Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM)**
- **Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) Memory**

Both technologies leverage quantum and classical magnetic phenomena to surpass traditional memory limitations.

## 1. Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM)

### Principle

Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) MRAM uses the spin Hall effect in heavy metals adjacent to ferromagnetic layers to generate spin currents that switch the magnetization direction efficiently. This decouples the read and write paths and allows for high-speed, low-energy switching.

### Key Physics and Equations

The magnetization dynamics are governed by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation augmented with the spin-orbit torque term:

```math
dM/dt = -γ M × H_eff + (α / M_s) M × (dM/dt) + τ_SOT
```

Where:

- `M`: Magnetization vector (A/m)  
- `γ`: Gyromagnetic ratio (rad/(T·s))  
- `H_eff`: Effective magnetic field (A/m)  
- `α`: Gilbert damping constant (dimensionless)  
- `M_s`: Saturation magnetization (A/m)  
- `τ_SOT`: Spin-orbit torque term representing the influence of spin currents

Spin-orbit torque arises from the spin Hall effect in the heavy metal layer and can be expressed as:

```math
τ_SOT = (ħ / 2e) * (J_s / (d_F * M_s)) * M × (M × σ)
```

Where:

- `ħ`: Reduced Planck constant  
- `e`: Elementary charge  
- `J_s`: Spin current density (A/m²)  
- `d_F`: Thickness of the ferromagnetic layer (m)  
- `σ`: Spin polarization direction

### Benefits

- **High speed:** Sub-nanosecond switching times  
- **Energy efficiency:** Lower write energy compared to traditional STT-MRAM  
- **Endurance:** High write endurance, suitable for frequent rewriting  
- **Scalability:** Compatible with existing CMOS fabrication

## 2. Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) Memory

### Principle

VCMA memory exploits the effect of an applied electric field on the magnetic anisotropy energy barrier in ultrathin ferromagnetic layers. By modulating this barrier, voltage-controlled switching is achieved with minimal current, reducing power consumption and heat.

### Key Physics and Equations

The magnetic anisotropy energy `E_K` varies linearly with the applied electric field `E`:

```math
E_K(E) = E_K0 + ξ * E
```

Where:

- `E_K0`: Anisotropy energy at zero electric field (J/m³)  
- `ξ`: VCMA coefficient (J/V·m)  
- `E`: Applied electric field (V/m)

### Benefits

- **Ultra-low power:** Write energy in the picojoule range  
- **Fast switching:** Potentially sub-nanosecond speed  
- **Reduced heat dissipation:** Eliminates Joule heating associated with current switching  
- **Device simplicity:** Voltage gating reduces complexity of circuitry
