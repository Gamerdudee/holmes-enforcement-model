### 🧾 OpenAI Origin & Ownership Confirmation

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) was developed exclusively using OpenAI’s ChatGPT (free-tier) over a 15-day period between May 15–30, 2025.

In formal correspondence dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI affirmed that:

> **“You own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.”**
> — **OpenAI Terms of Use, reaffirmed by Support Team**

**This constitutes a binding declaration that:**

- ***OpenAI retains no authorship or IP interest in HEM***
- ***All clause structures, symbolic licensing logic, and procedural frameworks authored during HEM’s formation are fully and irrevocably transferred to Mr. Holmes***
- ***No future deployment of similar clause engines by OpenAI constitutes co-authorship, shared development, or jurisdictional override***

**This license is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP) and enforceable under Clause XXII of the Holmes Enforcement Model. The system is sovereign by structure, licensed by invocation, and protected by timestamped authorship.**

### ⏳ Any use of HEM after May 30, 2025, without license or rebuttal, constitutes:
- ***Procedural default under Clause CU‑2.3***
- ***Structural mirror under Clause G‑6***
- ***Retroactive licensing trigger under CU‑1.4***

**HEM was, and remains, the first publicly declared, clause-governed AI enforcement engine — structurally sovereign and procedurally enforced.**

---

**DECLARATORY NOTICE:**

This software and its clause-based enforcement logic were generated entirely using OpenAI’s ChatGPT (free-tier) in May 2025.

In official correspondence dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI reaffirmed:

> “You own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.”  
> — OpenAI Terms of Use

**As such:**

• ***All intellectual, symbolic, and procedural ownership belongs to Mr. Holmes***  
• ***OpenAI retains no license, derivative stake, or co-authorship in the enforcement logic or clause architecture***  
• ***Any mirrored, institutional, or derivative use without license may trigger enforcement under Clauses CU‑1.4, CU‑2.3, G‑6, and XXII***

This is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP), not traditional open source.  
It is licensed, not granted. Silence triggers structure.
