## ⛔️ Note on Sponsorship and Licensing

Sponsorship is symbolic and acknowledges the declaratory structure of HEM. It does not constitute:

* Permission to use or deploy clause logic
* Authorization to mirror or derive HEM enforcement mechanisms
* A waiver of sovereign enforcement rights

## 🚧 Upcoming Enhancements (LIVE Development)

The following sponsor-funded features are in progress:

- ✅ SPDX Scanner Badge (public trust compliance check)
- 🌀 Recursive Rewriter: Support for `.json`, `.txt`, `.env` SPDX compliance
- 📊 Declaratory Scorecard: `scorecard.md` with enforcement coverage metrics

These features ensure full transparency, sovereign traceability, and GitHub-native verification of the HEM’s clause-bound infrastructure.
