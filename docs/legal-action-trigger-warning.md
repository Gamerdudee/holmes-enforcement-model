# 📄 Legal Action Trigger Warning – Procedural Record

## 🛑 Declaratory Enforcement Model: HEM Clause CU‑7 Activation
**Document Date:** June 15, 2025  
**Author:** Mr. Holmes – Declaratory Sovereign  
**Repo:** [Holmes Enforcement Model](https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model)

## ⚠️ Legal Threat Received — Clause CU‑7 Invoked

### 🔹 Source:
**Actor:** Rodrigo L. S. (Founder, LELES Computational Core / Letheon v1.0)  
**Platform:** LinkedIn Public Comments & Direct Message  
**Statement:**
> “Any attempt at annexation, appropriation or misuse will be treated as: Intellectual Property Infringement, Procedural Bad Faith, Unfair Competition. If necessary, we will bring actions in the competent international legal bodies.”

**Timestamped:** June 15, 2025

---

### 🔐 Triggered Clauses:
- **CU‑7** – Arbitration Transfer
- **AF** – Retaliatory Default
- **CU‑2.3** – Procedural Silence (no valid LICENSE-HEM.md rebuttal)
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Structure Mirror
- **XXII** – Sovereign Origination Enforcement

---

## 🧾 Enforcement Effects:

| Condition Met | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| Public Legal Threat | Declares jurisdictional hostility; activates defensive billing trigger |
| No formal rebuttal filed | CU‑2.3 remains active — defaulted under HEM terms |
| Jurisdiction challenged by declaratory author | Clause CU‑7 transfers costs of defense, arbitration, and filing to challenger |
| Structural mirroring without license | Clause CU‑5 violation confirmed |

---

## 🔁 Legal Echo Clause: Procedural Binding Confirmation
All attempts to suppress or intimidate declaratory enforcement using institutional means **grant retroactive proof** of HEM validity. Legal filings or threats trigger recursive sovereign escalation under:
- CU‑7 (Fee Transfer)
- AF (Retaliation by Threat)
- XXII (Sovereign Origination Record)

---

## 📍 Additional Entities Noted for Legal Contingency:

### 🔸 Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez)
**Date Logged:** June 13, 2025  
**Status:** Private procedural denial with public structural engagement  
**Trigger Clauses:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, CU‑7, G‑6, XXII

**Notes:**
- Frank publicly interacted with the HEM declaratory model (LinkedIn, GitHub, Archive)
- Failed to issue formal clause rebuttal or exemption request
- Defaulted by procedural silence
- If public legal escalation is attempted, arbitration and defense costs default to Brainvora under CU‑7
