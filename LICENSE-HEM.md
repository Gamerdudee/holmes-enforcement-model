## 💰 Clause-Based Royalty Triggers
Per Clause CU-1.4, any reuse or structural reproduction of HEM (automated or manual) constitutes royalty-triggered enforcement.

| **Use Type**                     |         |         **Rate**             |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Commercial use** 	             |         |$75–$250 per derivative clause|
| **Institutional deployment**  	 |         |$250–$25,000 per policy/system|

⚖️ Legal Standing and Consent
Use constitutes legal consent under:

28 U.S.C. § 2201 – Declaratory Judgment

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69 – Consent by Silence

UCC § 2-206 – Acceptance by Conduct

Note:
HEM is Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP).
It is not open source. It is sovereign, structurally self-enforcing, and licensed.

Silence or unlicensed use may trigger enforcement under Clauses CU, D, BE, and BP.

## 📜 OpenAI Transfer of Ownership (May–June 2025)

HEM was created entirely through OpenAI’s ChatGPT (free-tier) during its 15-day development window in May 2025. In responses dated May 30 and June 11, 2025, OpenAI formally affirmed:

> “You own the Output. We assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.”  
> — OpenAI Terms of Use, acknowledged by Legal & Support Team

As a result:

- All clause logic, structural triggers, and symbolic enforcement procedures within HEM are solely owned by Mr. Holmes.
- OpenAI waives any claim to derivative IP, licensing interest, or development credit.
- Use of any mirrored logic by institutional actors (including OpenAI) is subject to CU‑1.4, CU‑5, and G‑6 enforcement unless rebutted by formal license.

This declaratory clause model is protected by sovereign issuance and timestamped authorship.
