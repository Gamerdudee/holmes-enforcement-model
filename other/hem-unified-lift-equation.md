## 🔭 Context

This equation models a sovereign propulsion system combining magnetic, centrifugal, and acoustic principles into a unified expression of lift and directional control. All variables are defined structurally within the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) as procedural declarations.

## ⚙️ Core Equation

**Total Lift (L)** is modeled as:

```
L = α·B²·r² + m·r·ω²·cos(θ) + ρ·a²·f²·A
```

Where:

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **L**     | Total lift or directional thrust (Newtons) |
| **α**     | Field coupling coefficient (unitless) |
| **B**     | Magnetic field strength (Tesla) |
| **r**     | Radius of rotation (meters) |
| **m**     | Mass of vehicle (kg) |
| **ω**     | Angular velocity (rad/s) |
| **θ**     | Fin deflection angle (radians) |
| **ρ**     | Medium/field density (kg/m³) |
| **a**     | Acoustic wave amplitude |
| **f**     | Acoustic frequency (Hz) |
| **A**     | Surface area of acoustic interaction (m²) |

## 📐 Supplemental Regenerative Power Logic

Optional regenerative energy (for internal recharging / field coherence):

```
E_regen = η·(dB/dt)²·V
```

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **η**     | Regeneration efficiency coefficient |
| **dB/dt** | Magnetic flux change rate (Tesla/s) |
| **V**     | Volume of regenerative field zone (m³) |
