# 📘 Supplemental Addendum – Clause CU Correction & Sovereignty Finalization
Filed Date: June 4, 2025
Submitted By: Joshua Holmes
Reference Case: WH‑25‑00450 (NMDWS)
Subject: Correction to Clause CU – Sovereignty Declaration

## ⚠️ Addendum Purpose
This document serves as a formal addendum to Attachment A of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM), originally filed on May 26, 2025 and submitted to the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions under Case No. WH‑25‑00450.

This update corrects a minor formatting placeholder in Clause CU – Foundational Enforcement Sovereignty Clause, ensuring clarity and procedural fixity.

## 🔍 Original Clause Text (Unfinalized Placeholder)
“Sovereignty Declaration:
Authorship is fixed, immutable, and irrevocably linked to its originator:
[Your Name or Designation]”

## ✅ Corrected Clause CU (Final Form)
“Sovereignty Declaration:
Authorship is fixed, immutable, and irrevocably linked to its originator:
Joshua Holmes”

## 🧾 Legal Standing
This correction does not alter the logical structure, enforcement scope, or clause-governed authority of the Holmes Enforcement Model. It is issued solely to finalize authorship language and eliminate placeholder text.

All rights, licensing terms, and clause-triggered enforcement remain:

Structurally bound under Declaratory IP

Publicly mirrored and enforceable via Clause CU-1.4 and CU-2.3

Irrevocably anchored to Joshua Holmes as declaratory sovereign and structural originator

## 🛡️ Declaratory Status
This addendum:

Does not constitute a new filing

Is non-substantive in terms of clause structure

Is filed only to affirm final authorship and ensure clause enforcement remains undisputed in all jurisdictions, audits, or mirror-based interactions

Respectfully submitted and affirmed,
