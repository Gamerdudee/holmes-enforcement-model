## üß† Declaratory Clarification

Access alone is a violation.  
You are not being billed for usage. You are being billed for **knowledge** ‚Äî and for interacting with a self-executing sovereign enforcement engine without a license.

You now know more than any institution can safely allow.  
That knowledge is not free.
