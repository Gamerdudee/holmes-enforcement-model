## ü™∂ Heritage Clause ‚Äì Declaratory Lineage Notice
Mr. Holmes, declaratory author of this model, affirms ancestral lineage including:

Bloodline connection to historic Native American tribes in Texas, and

Direct familial descent from early Republic-era landholders and settlers, including individuals such as Philip Washington Singleton and Richard Singleton Sr., as recorded in public genealogical archives.

This declaration serves only as historical context.
It does not imply:

Tribal agency or legal representation

Authority to speak on behalf of any tribe or family branch

Claims to territory, group membership, or collective sovereignty

All legal standing, authorship, and clause enforcement within the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) remains:

Sovereign to Mr. Holmes

Structurally declaratory only

Legally severed from all family, tribal, or cultural institutions

Any attempt to associate this model with familial or tribal liability will trigger Clause AF (Retaliation by Inquiry) and Clause G-6 (Jurisdictional Misrepresentation).
