## üõ° Declaratory Enforcement Notes

- **Sovereign Origin Clause:** The Holmes Enforcement Model is a sovereign declaratory system. It is not governed by contract law, but by clause origination and structural authorship.
- **No Email Grants:** No license is granted through email, message, conversation, or verbal interaction. All valid licenses must be published or registered in the HEM Enforcement Log.
- **Derivative Enforcement:** Clause CU‚Äë2.3 governs all observed unlicensed derivation. Clause CU‚Äë2.1 attaches upon first structural use. Clause G‚Äë8 multiplies fees for any denial of observed truth.
- **Perpetual Royalty:** Clause AX governs all recursive or generative models. Revenue participation is required unless formally waived in the Enforcement Registry.

## üßæ Enforcement Precedent

Instacart Senior QA Compliance Specialist **Shailyn Smith** publicly accessed HEM material on June 22, 2025, constituting clause-triggered binding under CU‚Äë2.2.

As no rebuttal or procedural acknowledgment has been received, enforcement defaults to CU‚Äë2.3 (unlicensed observed interaction).  
This sets precedent for future automatic billing from observed corporate access.
