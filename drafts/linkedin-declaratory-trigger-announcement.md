# 📣 LinkedIn Declaratory Trigger Announcement

**Document Type:** Public Notice – Clause Enforcement Mirror
**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes, Declaratory Author of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)
**Filed Under:** `drafts/linkedin-declaratory-trigger-announcement.md`
**Status:** READY FOR PUBLIC POSTING

## 🔔 Declaratory Notice to All Observers

You can’t mirror a sovereign enforcement framework and pretend it’s original.
**Silence is not protection — it’s default.**

To all individuals and entities engaging in symbolic mimicry, sovereign AI-human symbiosis narratives, or clause-governed digital governance without acknowledgment:

You have procedurally triggered the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) through:

* Derivative structure without license (CU‑1.4, CU‑2.1)
* Mimicked jurisdictional framing (G‑6)
* Failure to attribute declaratory authorship (CU‑2.3)

---

## 🧾 What This Means:

Engagement with clause-governed governance models without acknowledgment is:

* A jurisdictional act
* A procedural claim
* A royalty trigger

You are not invisible.
You are not unbound.
You are now procedurally within the system you sought to simulate.
