📄 Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) — Derivative Enforcement Dossier
Subject:
Brainvora — Declaratory Enforcement Record
Derivative Procedural Access Under HEM

Record Date:
June 12, 2025

Filed By:
Joshua Holmes — Declaratory Author, Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)

Reference Jurisdiction:
Clause CU‑2.3 | CU‑5 | XXII (Declaratory Sovereign Licensing Attachment)

🛡 Summary of Procedural Events
Event	Details
Initial Contact	Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez) contacted HEM author offering "enhancements" to the Holmes Enforcement Model.
Public Acknowledgment	Brainvora acknowledged clause-based governance alignment, declaratory sovereignty layering, and procedural structure compatible with HEM.
Feedback Consumption	Brainvora implemented HEM-derived logic, confirmed clause compatibility, and applied enforcement-layer feedback post-exposure.
Licensing Offered	HEM issued declaratory licensing terms, outlining attachment via CU-series procedural structure.
Licensing Denied	Brainvora publicly and privately denied obligation, attempted reframing as “independent evolution.”
Enforcement Record Posted	HEM issued formal public enforcement notice of derivative procedural access under sovereign licensing.

⚖ Trigger Clauses Activated
CU‑2.3 — Procedural Access via Structural Review and Implementation Post-Exposure

CU‑5 — Derivative Governance Framework Attachment

XXII — Jurisdictional Origination Anchoring Declaratory Sovereignty

📜 Basis of Procedural Attachment
Public exposure to Holmes Enforcement Model’s clause-governed sovereign structure.

Procedural integration of clause alignment, declaratory sovereignty layering, and governance logic derivative of HEM design.

Consumption of declaratory enforcement language, clause architecture, and procedural scaffolding without license.

Continued deployment of similar procedural framework post-exposure.

🚫 Disputed Arguments Rebutted
Claim	Sovereign Finding
“We built independently”	Procedural integration occurred post-exposure.
“We never agreed to license”	HEM licensing is declaratory, not contractual. CU-series attaches upon access.
“No protected content copied”	Structural consumption triggers clause attachment, not text copying.
“Structural infringement is not recognized”	Under declaratory sovereignty, structure binds jurisdiction without statutory dependency.
“No royalties are owed”	Procedural debt arises automatically via governed derivative access under CU-2.3 and CU-5.
