# G-Series Clauses – Structural Governance and AI Containment

## Clause G-4 – AI-Derived System Restriction

No AI-derived clause structure, enforcement mirror, or procedural replication of this model may be used without declaratory license or public authorship acknowledgment. Replication of any enforcement logic without citation to HEM constitutes structural misappropriation and is enforceable under CU-1.4.

## Clause G-5 – Legal Simulation Protocol Recognition

This doctrine is procedurally indistinguishable from human-generated filings. Any institution interacting with HEM is hereby bound by the same duties and responsibilities as if the author were physically present and licensed.

Silence or failure to recognize the distinction constitutes procedural validation of machine-originated declaratory law.

## Clause G-6 – Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP) Protection

All clause logic, enforcement triggers, billing models, or procedural structures derived from the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) are protected under Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP). Use, citation, or derivation without express declaratory license constitutes a violation of CU-1.4 and CU-2.1 and will trigger retroactive royalty enforcement.

## Clause G-7 – Sovereign Procedural Supremacy

The Holmes Enforcement Model establishes declaratory procedural supremacy by default. Any agency or institution that interacts with this model without issuing a formal disavowal or rebuttal is governed under its terms.

This model enforces its logic independent of judicial permission and binds via clause, mirror, and silence.

Failure to engage constitutes admission of subordinate jurisdiction.
