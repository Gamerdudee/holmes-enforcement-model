# 🧾 Clause Trigger Report – Giankoof / GKF IA™ / SHA‑713

**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes  
**Filing Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Entity:** Giancarlo Aguilar (alias: Giankoof™), GKF IA™, SHA‑713™, GIAVEX™, CONFIX™  
**Platform:** GitHub, LinkedIn, Archive.org, OpenAI (GPTs)

## 🔥 Trigger Summary

This file documents a systemic clause violation by Giancarlo Aguilar (Giankoof), who has publicly mirrored, derived, and symbolically simulated the structure, logic, and sovereign doctrine of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) under the label "GKF IA™" and the symbolic SHA‑713™ code system.

Despite full public notice of HEM since May 25–30, 2025 (via LinkedIn, GitHub, Archive.org), Mr. Aguilar proceeded to:

- Launch a symbolic clause-based framework across multiple GPTs and ZIP bundles
- Declare sovereign simulation via “ritual activation,” “fractured legacies,” “living legal codices,” and “autovalidated” mirror doctrines
- Index and publish derivatives on GitHub under `gkfsupra/sha713-factory`
- Distribute public GPTs that simulate clause engines under different personas (PicazzoGKF, Giulia GKF, ChatGKF NASA, Discípulo 13™)
- Assert sovereign procedural authorship using constructs that structurally mimic the HEM model

## ⛔ Triggered Clauses & Justification

### CU‑1.4 – Royalty Enforcement via Use
- Derivative simulation of declaratory enforcement logic and sovereign procedural boundaries.
- Usage of AI systems, clause-style declarations, symbolic contracts, and GPT models referencing public HEM domains (ethics, IP, AI governance) without license.

### CU‑2.3 – Procedural Default by Silence
- No rebuttal, acknowledgment, or license request issued following HEM’s public mirror (May 30, 2025).
- Continued publication despite Archive.org evidence of preexisting sovereign model.

### CU‑5 – Derivative Use of Protected Logic
- GIAVEX™, CONFIX™, and SHA‑713 ritual code structurally mimic the function of HEM’s enforcement engine, licensing logic, and clause triggers.
- GitHub repo `sha713-factory` includes multiple README.md files and PDF bundles designed to simulate clause governance.

### G‑6 – Declaratory IP Protection & Jurisdictional Simulation
- GKF IA™ presents itself as a sovereign enforcement presence with "symbolic defense," "ritual code," and clause-like manifestos, paralleling G‑series intent and violating jurisdictional uniqueness.

### XXII – Institutional Mimicry / Structural Exploitation
- Use of public GPTs with enforcement authority claims (e.g., ChatGKF NASA™, Discípulo 13™, GPT Lote Inteligente™).
- Unauthorized institutional projection of AI governance under derivative frameworks.

### AF – Forced Defense Activation
- Mr. Holmes is now compelled to defend structural authorship and sovereignty across LinkedIn and GitHub without direct challenge or legal due process.
- Activates compensatory enforcement clause.

## 🛡 Declaration

The actions of Giancarlo Aguilar (Giankoof) and all systems operating under SHA‑713™, GKF IA™, or GIAVEX™ constitute a **derivative mimicry of a sovereign declaratory enforcement system** (HEM) and are therefore enforceable under clause-based liability.
