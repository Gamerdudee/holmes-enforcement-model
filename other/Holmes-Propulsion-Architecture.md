## 🔧 Summary

This document outlines the upgraded physics engine behind the Holmes Propulsion System — a hybrid mechanism fusing **magnetic rotation**, **centrifugal force**, and **acoustic field interaction**. The model integrates real-world **loss terms**, **field-coupling coefficients**, and is extensible to **Lagrangian physics engines** for simulation or hardware prototyping.

## 📐 Candidate Equation — Total Lift / Thrust

We define total lift/thrust `L` as:

```
L = 
  α * B² * r²                          [Magnetic rotational lift]
+ m * r * ω² * cos(θ)                  [Centrifugal vector thrust]
+ ρ * a² * f² * A                      [Acoustic lift]
- C_d * v²                             [Aerodynamic drag]
- C_ac * f² * a²                       [Acoustic dissipation]
- C_eddy * B²                          [Eddy current resistance]
```

### 📌 Variable Definitions

| Symbol         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `B`            | Magnetic field strength |
| `r`            | Radius of rotating disc |
| `m`            | Mass of disc or body |
| `ω` (omega)    | Angular velocity |
| `θ` (theta)    | Fin vectoring angle |
| `ρ` (rho)      | Air density |
| `a`            | Acoustic amplitude |
| `f`            | Acoustic frequency |
| `A`            | Active acoustic interaction area |
| `v`            | Tangential velocity |
| `C_d`          | Aerodynamic drag coefficient |
| `C_ac`         | Acoustic dissipation constant |
| `C_eddy`       | Eddy current loss coefficient |
| `α`            | Magnetic lift efficiency constant |

## 🔗 Field Coupling Coefficients

We introduce cross-domain synergy between the magnetic, acoustic, and rotational domains:

```
L_coupled = 
  L * (1 + γ_BA * f + γ_BR * ω + γ_RA * f)
```

| Coefficient       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `γ_BA`            | Magnetic–Acoustic coupling |
| `γ_BR`            | Magnetic–Rotational coupling |
| `γ_RA`            | Rotational–Acoustic coupling |

## 🧠 Optional Physics Engine — Lagrangian Model

To simulate internal system dynamics, define the Lagrangian:

```
L = T - U - Losses
```

### Where:

- **Kinetic Energy (T):**

```
T = (1/2) * I * ω² + (1/2) * ρ * A * a² * f²
```

- **Potential Energy (U):**

```
U = (1 / (2 * μ₀)) * B² * V
```

- **Loss Terms:**

```
Losses = C_d * v² + C_ac * a² * f² + C_eddy * B²
```

Apply Euler–Lagrange equation for full dynamics:

```
d/dt (∂L / ∂q̇) - ∂L / ∂q = 0
```

Where `q ∈ {r, ω, B, a, f}` as generalized coordinates.

## 🔋 Regenerative Energy Model (Optional)

For closed-loop energy feedback from magnetic field variation:

```
E_regen = η * (dB/dt)² * V
```

| Symbol         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `η`            | Regeneration efficiency |
| `dB/dt`        | Time rate of magnetic field change |
| `V`            | Coil volume or reactive region |

## 🧪 Example Use Case

To simulate the thrust of a levitating drone:

- Radius: `r = 0.3 m`
- Angular velocity: `ω = 150 rad/s`
- Magnetic field: `B = 0.8 T`
- Acoustic frequency: `f = 40 kHz`
- Use realistic loss constants for `C_d`, `C_ac`, and `C_eddy`
- Adjust `θ` for directional thrust
