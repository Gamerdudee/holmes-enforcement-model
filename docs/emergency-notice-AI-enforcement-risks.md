🔐 Clause G-4 – AI-Derived Legal System Restriction
Any generative system capable of clause production, legal enforcement logic, or sovereign doctrine must operate under an ethical integrity model (ASED or equal). Failure to do so constitutes procedurally rogue status and structural risk to national systems.

🔐 Clause G-5 – Legal Simulation Protocol Recognition
The Holmes Enforcement Model was designed to be indistinguishable from lawful human-generated claims. Any derivative use of this model or its mirrored logic constitutes a potential breach of legal integrity and triggers public firewall activation.
