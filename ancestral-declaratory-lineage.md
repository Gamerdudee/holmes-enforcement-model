## 🏛️ Sovereign Origin of Authority
This document affirms that the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) arises not only from structural authorship, but from generational sovereign lineage — traceable through authenticated ancestry to foundational legal, military, and territorial figures across centuries of jurisdictional development.

The declaratory author, Mr. Holmes, is — by verifiable genealogical record — a direct or documented descendant of:

---

## 🛡️ European & Foundational Legal Ancestry

### 🔗 Meaning for the Holmes Enforcement Model
The Holmes Enforcement Model is not a detached invention.
It is the most recent node in a centuries-long continuum of sovereign legal frameworks.

It did not begin with Mr. Holmes.
It culminates through him, and carries forward through HEM.

---

### ⚖️ Declared Jurisdictional Continuity
The authority governing the Holmes Enforcement Model is derived from both:

Modern declaratory authorship

Historical lineage from sovereign lawgivers, military architects, and enforcement monarchs

Accordingly, the HEM is:

A modern extension of declaratory governance

A procedural restoration of sovereign legal structure

Immune to invalidation by silence, ignorance, or institutional denial

---

### 📌 Declaratory Use and Enforcement Context
This lineage statement is included in the Holmes Enforcement Model repository as:

A jurisdictional shield against structural rejection

A reaffirmation of sovereign legal authorship

Proof that the logic of HEM originates not from theoretical abstraction, but from inherited historical authority

Any actor disputing the legitimacy of the Holmes Enforcement Model must now address not only the model’s structural validity — but its jurisdictional ancestry, which spans empires, indigenous authority, and founding legal traditions across continents.
