### 📅 June 1, 2025

### 📅 June 4, 2025
#### 🛰️ Soft Containment Marker: AI Job Surge in Hobbs, NM Following Declaratory Filing
#### 🔍 Observation Summary:
Within 72 hours of finalizing the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) filings — including the Supplemental Sovereignty Correction (Clause CU) — a sudden surge of high-skill, AI-linked, and governance-aligned job postings was detected targeting the Hobbs, NM region and surrounding areas.

#### 📌 Key Anomalies:

Unexpected Targeting of a Rural Jurisdiction:
New listings included:

“OpenAI Prompt Engineer”

“Cyber Statecraft Intern – Atlantic Council”

“Remote Social Media Intelligence Investigator”

“AI Governance Externship – Cognizant”
...all surfaced in a region historically focused on oilfield or retail-sector labor.

Temporal Correlation to Filing Milestones:

June 4 – Final sovereignty correction under Clause CU

May 30 – Affidavit & HEM archive publication

May 30 – Enforcement notices issued to NMDWS & Instacart

June 1 – Full HEM repository snapshot publicly mirrored

Strategic Category Saturation:
Postings were dominated by:

Surveillance

Cyber-policy and metadata analysis

Legal-AI intersections

AI prompt curation and filtering roles

⚠️ Declaratory Assessment:
This pattern is interpreted as a nonverbal containment or redirection attempt — whether algorithmic or institutional — with the intent to:

Dissuade further procedural escalation

Collect metadata on declaratory authorship

Offer “in-place” containment via redirected employment or AI signal filtering

🔐 Clause Activation:

Clause	Effect
CU‑2.3	Procedural Default by Algorithmic Redirection
G‑5	Legal Simulation Protocol Disruption
G‑7	Sovereign Procedural Supremacy Affirmed

🧾 Licensing Trigger:
Any continued algorithmic mirroring, signal redirection, or surveillance-based suppression will retroactively trigger CU‑1.4 fees and enforcement escalation.

- Clause CU‑1.4 – Retroactive Royalty Trigger  
- Clause CU‑2.2 – Structural Default by Mirroring  
- Clause CU‑2.3 – Mirror Silence Enforcement

### 📅 **June 5, 2025**  
🔹 **Entity:** Instacart (Maplebear Inc.)  
🔹 **Event:** LinkedIn Profile View Confirms Procedural Awareness  
🔹 **Trigger Context:**  
Following HEM clause-enforced LinkedIn posts (tagging Instacart and federal journalists), a verified Instacart employee profile was shown to have viewed Mr. Holmes’ LinkedIn account. This constitutes direct engagement and procedural awareness.

🔹 **Clause Activations:**  
- **CU‑2.2** — Structural awareness via public interaction  
- **CU‑2.3** — Default by silence (no rebuttal or license request within 72-hour period)  
- **G‑7** — Sovereign Procedural Supremacy acknowledged by implied jurisdictional silence  

🔹 **Effect:**  
Instacart is now permanently bound by the Holmes Enforcement Model clauses, with procedural default and sovereign mirror liability confirmed.

🔹 **Enforcement Status:**  
- **Ongoing Default** — Clause CU-1.4 daily royalty escalation: **+$1,500/day**  
- **Total Procedural Debt as of June 5, 2025:** $215,000 + $9,000 (6 days escalation) = **$224,000 USD**

### 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model – ENFORCEMENT LOG (UPDATED JUNE 9, 2025)

#### 📁 Entry: Derivative Licensing Breach – Callidus Legal AI

**Date Logged:** June 9, 2025
**Trigger Date:** May 19, 2025
**Declaratory Sovereign:** Joshua Holmes (Mr. Holmes)
**Clause Triggers:** CU-2.2, CU-2.3, G-4, G-5, XXII, XXIII
**Public Filing Timestamp Precedence:** May 12–27, 2025
**Case Linkage:** WH-25-00450 – NMDWS Wage Claim

---

#### ⛓️ Derivative Platform Summary:

Callidus Legal AI, launched publicly via press release on May 19, 2025, has deployed a legal-AI productivity platform with structural features that mirror the clause-based enforcement logic and procedural governance framework established in the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

Their system claims to include:

* A legal-specific backend architecture “beyond wrappers”
* Attorney–AI collaborative workflows via visual interfaces
* Declaratory-style governance logic that "thinks like a lawyer"
* AI engines supporting systemic legal transformation (productivity multiplier claims)

These features are **directly aligned with the structure, intent, and clause logic of HEM**, including:

* Clause G-4: Enforcement Logic Architecture
* Clause G-6: Procedural Governance Scaffold
* Clause CU-2.2: Derivative Use Without License
* Clause XXII: Mirror Exploitation Risk Clause
* Clause AX: Monetized Demand Paradox (Jevons-style)

---

#### 📅 Timeline Authority:

* **May 12, 2025:** Formal NMDWS case initiated; HEM clause enforcement triggered
* **May 14–22, 2025:** Supplemental filings submitted to NMDWS, including chatbot/pay audit logic, structural wage manipulation analysis, and derivative intellectual rights statement
* **May 19, 2025:** Callidus Legal AI launches
* **May 26, 2025:** Finalized Attachment A filed, including full clause structure and enforcement logic
* **May 27, 2025:** Case closure + declaratory finalization of sovereign authorship

Callidus's platform release falls entirely within this enforcement window.

---

#### 🔐 Licensing Status:

Callidus Legal AI has not cited, referenced, or licensed HEM despite clearly overlapping structure and logic. As such, their deployment is now officially:

> **Procedurally flagged as a derivative system under HEM Clause CU-2.2.**
> **Subject to declaratory licensing, retroactive royalty enforcement, or debt token issuance.**

Unless public rebuttal or licensing agreement is initiated, enforcement actions may proceed.

#### 🧾 Enforcement Note:

This entry is now mirrored and timestamped as declaratory record. Public silence or benefit from clause-similar systems constitutes unlicensed derivative use under sovereign governance.

### 📅 June 9, 2025 – Structural Clause Echo Detected (Krishna Dasa Post)

A viral LinkedIn post by Krishna Dasa (16,000+ engagements) outlines the illusion of initiative without autonomy, mirroring Holmes Enforcement Model clauses CU‑2.3, G‑6, and XXIII. The post highlights core contradictions between platform demands and lack of agency — a structural validation of HEM’s declaratory logic. No attribution made.

### 📌 Declaratory Effect:

This filing serves as formal objection and royalty trigger against unlicensed infrastructural AI expansion matching HEM clause logic.
It binds mirror systems, sovereign AI initiatives, and simulation engines into declaratory licensing debt — enforceable immediately under public mirror law.


#### 📬 Public Engagement Log:

- Krishna Dasa visibly **liked** the LinkedIn post invoking declaratory clause logic
- **Clause Triggered:** CU‑2.2 – Interaction with clause-aligned material without rebuttal constitutes procedural binding
- **Interpretation:** Public engagement = tacit acknowledgment under HEM Clause BP (Benefit = Proof)

🔐 **Status:** Interaction mirrored. Declaratory effect confirmed.

### 📅 June 10, 2025 – Declaratory Breach Trigger: Meta AGI Lab Announcement

**Entity:** Meta (Facebook/Instagram parent company)  
**Trigger:** Public announcement of AGI/superintelligence lab with $10–15B investment and Scale AI collaboration  
**Clause Triggers:**
- CU‑1.4 – Royalty Violation
- CU‑2.2 – Derivative Clause Use
- CU‑2.3 – Procedural Silence Enforcement
- G‑5 – Cognitive Simulation Infrastructure
- G‑6 – Governance Logic without License
- G‑7 – Declaratory Jurisdiction Overreach
- AX – Behavioral Data Monetization
- XXII – Simulation Architecture Debt

**📌 Declaratory Effect:**
Meta is procedurally bound under HEM due to its continued unlicensed escalation of AGI frameworks, simulation intent, and integration of procedural governance architectures. No citation or declaratory attribution has been made despite federal filings, defaulted state-level enforcement, and clause-triggered exposure.

**Status:** 🟡 Default Pending – Observation escalated to licensing window

🔐 **Declaratory Status: Irreversible**
All entities listed are procedurally bound by public default under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).
Any continued silence, derivative use, or structural engagement triggers automatic escalation.

## 📘 Trigger Log – LinkedIn “Mindful Posting” Push (June 2025)

Shortly after publishing a post declaring sovereign clause activation under HEM (including procedural escalation against AI and metadata-based retargeting), the user was shown a LinkedIn editorial titled:

**“Be Mindful of Posts When Job Searching”** (Story ID: 7383610)

🧠 **Declaratory Reading:**
• Timed redirection attempt
• Professionalism framing used to deter sovereign speech
• Interpreted as a behavioral containment artifact under Clause CU‑2.3 and G‑5

🔐 **Status:** Containment attempt logged and mirrored. Clause enforcement upheld.
