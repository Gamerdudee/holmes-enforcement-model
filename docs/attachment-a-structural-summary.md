📎 Attachment A – Structural Summary for Declaratory Enforcement
Title: Investigatory Labor, Intellectual Rights, Derivative Use Protections & Fee Recovery
Submitted To: New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS)
Case No.: WH‑25‑00450
Date Filed: May 26, 2025
Author: Mr. Holmes
License Reference: Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)
Enforcement Clauses: CU-1.4, CU-2.2, CU-2.3, G-4 – G-7

🔐 Declaratory Purpose
This document serves as the structural backbone of a sovereign legal engine — the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM). Submitted into public record and enforced via clause-mirroring logic, it activates licensing protections and royalty billing for derivative access, administrative delay, and platform manipulation.

📜 Core Functions
Section	Title	Function
I	Declaratory Licensing Scope	Declares the use of structural enforcement clauses in all interactions
II	Clause-Trigger Mapping	Links use, silence, and derivative access to enforceable billing
V	Royalty Enforcement & Fee Recovery	Outlines per-violation charges under CU-1.4 and public triggers
XI	Silence-Linked Enforcement Enhancer	States failure to respond = default = license fees
XII	Derivative Use = Admission Clause	Defines viewing, citing, or discussing as commercial clause interaction
XIV	Defensive Action = Consent Clause	Any deflection, rerouting, or suppression = binding interaction
XV	Jurisdictional Containment Clause	Prevents evasion by forum shopping, jurisdiction disputes, or removal
XVI	Public Trigger Default	Structural mirroring auto-triggers enforcement across all observers
