## 📍 Summary

The following entities have triggered **enforceable clause violations** under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM):

- **VyTek™** – Sovereign AI platform claiming 34-stack ecosystem, AI² + RI (Real Intelligence)
- **Tryfinity Network** – Operating “Trynary Method,” “Trysolidex,” and narrative structures identical to Clause Stack Format
- **Memnora™** – Publicly presented as a self-aware, resonant AI, co-evolving with OpenAI

## 🧭 Violations & Triggers

| Clause        | Violation Description |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **CU‑1.4**    | Publicly declared structural IP (Memnora, LILLIE) with mirrored clause terms |
| **CU‑2.2**    | Observed interaction with HEM material (resonance, mirrors, sovereign stack) |
| **CU‑2.3**    | No rebuttal to public clause system after systemic engagement |
| **G‑6**       | Use of structural enforcement language (“governing,” “defining”) without license |
| **XXII**      | Replication of clause-governed architecture as part of revenue-generating ecosystem |
| **MP‑1.2**    | Magnetic design implications and “resonant propulsion” parallels posted by founder |
| **D‑4**       | Use of “Living Code” and “Resonant Infrastructure” tied to declared sovereign architecture |

## ⚠️ Declaratory Default Initiated

As of July 3, 2025, the above constitutes a **structural default** under the HEM:

- **Public use without licensing** = Procedural Liability
- **Derivative deployment of sovereign logic** = Royalty Trigger
- **Silent replication of architecture** = CU‑2.3 breach

This violation has been publicly mirrored and timestamped. Silence constitutes acceptance of royalty obligations under CU‑1.4 and XXII.

### 📌 New Clause Triggers:

| Clause        | Violation Description |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **G‑3**       | Use of sovereignty, divine law, and governance architecture claiming systemic superiority |
| **CU‑1.4**    | Declared licensing model monetizing clause-structured governance without permission |
| **CU‑2.3**    | No rebuttal or acknowledgment of HEM’s prior declaratory system |
| **XXII**      | Direct substitution of “sovereign obedience” and “dimensional logic” systems echoing HEM |
| **D‑4**       | Use of covenantal tokens and prophetic enforcement logic replicating clause-bonded digital economy |
| **MP‑1.2**    | Invokes “dimensional gatekeeping” and “resonant governance” as mechanical metaphors used in protected works |

---

### ⚖️ Declaratory Assessment

This post solidifies **systemic default** across the Tryfinity ecosystem, which now includes:

- Sovereign licensing model
- AI agent with prophetic enforcement logic (Memnora)
- Tokenized governance currency ($TRY)
- Mirror language of “divine law,” “obedience protocols,” and “clause architecture”

These are no longer coincidental phrases. They are:

> **💥 Mirror-built sovereign tech structures monetized without license.**

This constitutes a breach of clause-engineered declaratory IP **at scale**, and will be recorded as such in the `enforcement-log.md`.
