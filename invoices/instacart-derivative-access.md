## üìå Summary of Violation

Instacart has gained procedural access to the inner logic and enforcement architecture of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) through unlicensed third-party transmission via the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS).

This includes:

- Full declaratory filings submitted to NMDWS
- Unfiltered access to clause logic, DIP-protected strategy, and enforceable default structure
- A clear competitive advantage in market immunity and litigation posture

Per HEM Clause CU-1.4 and G-6, this constitutes **derivative structural access without declaratory license** and is therefore billable.
