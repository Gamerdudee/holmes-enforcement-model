## 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model — Sovereign Jurisdictional Restitution Declaration  
**Clause Series:** HEM–HJ (Historical Jurisdiction)  
**Filed Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes — Declaratory Sovereign Authority  
**Jurisdiction:** Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)  
**Enforcement Tier:** Phase III Activation  

---

### 🧬 Declaratory Standing  
This declaration affirms the sovereign right of Mr. Holmes and the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) to seek restitution not only for derivative intellectual property violations, but for **historical jurisdictional hostage-taking** across multiple epochs of legal, religious, political, and military conquest.

Said right is asserted by lineal authority and procedural authorship, in accordance with clauses HJ-1 through HJ-5 and CU‑1.4 (Foundational Sovereignty Enforcement).

### ⚖️ Historical Jurisdictional Hostage Periods  

#### 1️⃣ Viking-Norman Feudal Absorption (9th–11th Century)  
> Rollo de Normandie and his descendants were absorbed under expanding Catholic feudal empires, terminating Norse sovereign continuity via forced religious subjugation and dynastic assimilation.

#### 2️⃣ English-Norman Hostage Period (11th–13th Century)  
> Consolidations under the Plantagenet, Capetian, and Angevin courts restricted territorial inheritance from figures such as Henry I and Hugh d’Avranches. Feudal conversion extinguished autonomous jurisdiction over ancestral domains.

#### 3️⃣ Scottish-Union Absorption (14th–18th Century)  
> Sovereign Hamilton lines, including James Hamilton, 5th Lord of Cadzow, were displaced under the British Union Act. Independent Scottish parliamentary succession was forcibly ended under empire consolidation.

#### 4️⃣ Colonial & Republic Hostage Period (16th–19th Century)  
> Singleton, Smith, and Morales family lines—linked to early Texas governance and tribal sovereignty—were subjugated under Manifest Destiny, U.S. territorial annexation, Apache land dispossession, and the dissolution of the Republic of Texas.

#### 5️⃣ Modern Digital Hostage Period (21st Century)  
> AI platforms, corporations, and institutions have begun structurally repurposing clause logic, jurisdictional simulations, and governance architectures matching the Holmes Enforcement Model, without license, consent, or attribution—triggering immediate derivative debt and simulation interference claims.

### 🛡 Declaratory Right of Restoration  

By sovereign lineal succession and the absence of lawful governance rebuttal, Mr. Holmes asserts the following:

- **Jurisdictional restoration** over cognitive and digital governance domains under HEM.  
- **Rightful restitution** for centuries of jurisdictional expropriation through:  
  - Clause-driven royalty collection  
  - Derivative licensing enforcement  
  - Public structural citation  
- **Procedural immunity** from invalidation under CU-2.3 (Mirror Silence) and CU‑1.4.  
- **Self-triggered jurisdictional revival**, enforceable in absence of any formal treaty or institutional response.

---

### 📎 Legal Frameworks Invoked  

- **CU‑1.4** – Foundational Sovereignty Enforcement  
- **CU‑2.3** – Mirror Silence Default  
- **G‑5** – Simulation Interference Doctrine  
- **AX** – Public Citation Royalty Debt  
- **AU** – Perpetual Derivative Royalty Engine  
- **CO** – Declaratory Constitutional Override  
- **HJ** – Historical Jurisdictional Restitution Series (HJ‑1 through HJ‑5)

---

### 🔐 Binding Terms  

Any platform, government, institution, or AI governance actor engaging in:  
• Jurisdictional simulation  
• Clause reuse  
• Declaratory model replication  
• Derivative labor extraction  
—without explicit HEM license or public structural citation—  
**triggers enforcement under this declaration.**

HEM is procedurally **immune to nullification**, and restitution rights under the HJ-series are **irrevocably activated in perpetuity.**
