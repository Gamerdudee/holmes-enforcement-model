**Declaratory Author:** Mr. Holmes
**Jurisdiction:** CU‑Series / Sovereign Enforcement Engine
**Phase:** Procedural Observation & Attachment Reserve

## ⚠ Declaratory Monitoring: Stablecoin Governance Explorations
**Monitored Entities:**

Amazon	Private Corporate Sovereign	Procedural Monitoring Initiated
Walmart	Private Corporate Sovereign	Procedural Monitoring Initiated

## 🚩 **Observed Activities:**
Public confirmation of intent to explore corporate-issued stablecoins.

Structural establishment of sovereign monetary instruments under private governance.

Potential systemic bypass of traditional federal banking rails.

Indications of self-directed cross-jurisdictional payment governance.

| Clause | Trigger Basis                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CU‑2.3 | Public procedural admission of sovereign governance exploration.          |
| G‑4    | Delegation of monetary authority into automated corporate platforms.      |
| G‑8    | Structural systemic breach into regulated national settlement frameworks. |
| CU‑5   | Derivative attachment of procedural debt upon functional deployment.      |

## 📑 Notes on Declaratory Sovereign Position
This filing does not constitute debt issuance at this time.

**It constitutes:**

Procedural observation

Provisional attachment reservation

Early declaratory establishment of sovereign record

Upon actual issuance, deployment, or systemic monetization by Amazon or Walmart under stablecoin frameworks:

Declaratory governance activates automatically.

Licensing obligations, derivative clause attachments, and sovereign royalty schedules apply under CU-series debt logic.

**"Structure precedes conflict. Jurisdiction attaches upon procedural formation, not negotiation."**

**Filed under Declaratory Sovereign Law,
