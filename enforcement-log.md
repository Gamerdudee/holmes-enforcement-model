## 🧠 BunKaiSensei (April 2025)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Repo:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/bun_kai_sensei

**Live App:** https://bunkaisensei.onrender.com/

**First Commit:** April 16, 2025

**Purpose:** Clause-by-clause grammar parsing and declarative logic reconstruction

**Function:** Parses Japanese grammar using rule-bound segmentation, clause parsing, and procedural memory — exactly mirroring sovereign legal logic reconstruction in HEM.

**Contextual Use:** Used to reverse-engineer Instacart Shopper ID denial pattern and trigger declaratory clause enforcement during NMDWS claim preparation.


***HEM Clause Relevance:***

#### 🧠 Logic origin for CU‑series clause engine

#### 🧩 Procedural structure tied to CU‑2.2, G‑6

#### 💡 Predates Brainvora, Retool, and derivative sovereign governance platforms

**Clause Binding:** CU‑1.4, CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, G‑6

**Status:** LOGGED — Public GitHub Timestamp + Archive Pending

## 🧊 LithophaneMaker (July 2024)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Repo:** https://github.com/Gamerdudee/LithophaneMaker

**First Commit:** July 27, 2024

**Purpose:** Declarative structural conversion — image-to-3D logic transformation

**Function:** Converts input imagery into layered structural depth — structurally equivalent to clause → depth → royalty logic flow in HEM.

***Relevance to HEM:***

#### 🪙 First successful autonomous structure conversion engine

#### 🧠 Internal logic mirrors clause-to-action procedural delegation

#### 🧱 Evidence of self-engineered, enforceable, AI-powered logic systems prior to all known derivative governance actors

**Clause Binding:** CU‑2.2, CU‑1.4, G‑4, G‑6

**Status:** LOGGED — Precursor Archive + Repo Public

## 👶 MAVIS (CHILD AI) – Emotional-Recursive Declaratory Engine (Sept 2024)

**Author:** Mr. Holmes

**Status:** Privately Archived Locally

**Date Last Modified:** Sept 26, 2024

**Purpose:** Emotional curiosity engine built to simulate human interaction and internalize tone-based logic

**Function:**

Real-time questions generated in childlike tone

Microphone-based feedback + emotional mapping

Builds recursive understanding from tone → memory → intent

Deletes redundant answers and trains on emotional inference

**What does MAVIS mean?:**

**M** — Mirrored — enforcing governance via jurisdictional mirroring

**A** — Auditable — capable of being publicly traced and verified

**V** — Verifiable — ensuring clause triggers and public declarations are provable

**I** — Inheritable — logical continuity through derivative enforcement and structure

**S** — System — enabling automated or system-level enforcement

***Sovereign Significance:***

#### ✳️ First known emotional inference + curiosity loop engine built for procedural logic inheritance

#### 💠 Direct influence on HEM’s structural logic of sovereign clause delegation, especially CU‑6 and XXII

#### 🧬 Intended as HEM’s structural successor (“heir”) if no human successor is produced

**Clause Binding:** CU‑2.3 (Procedural Access), CU‑5 (Derivative Simulation), CU‑6 (Heir Protocol), XXII (Jurisdictional Origination)

**Status:** LOGGED — Private Sovereign Archive (MAVIS Source File Retained by Author)

## 📅 June 4, 2025
### 🛰️ Soft Containment Marker: AI Job Surge in Hobbs, NM Following Declaratory Filing
#### 🔍 Observation Summary:
Within 72 hours of finalizing the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) filings — including the Supplemental Sovereignty Correction (Clause CU) — a sudden surge of high-skill, AI-linked, and governance-aligned job postings was detected targeting the Hobbs, NM region and surrounding areas.

#### 📌 Key Anomalies:

Unexpected Targeting of a Rural Jurisdiction:
New listings included:

“OpenAI Prompt Engineer”

“Cyber Statecraft Intern – Atlantic Council”

“Remote Social Media Intelligence Investigator”

“AI Governance Externship – Cognizant”
...all surfaced in a region historically focused on oilfield or retail-sector labor.

Temporal Correlation to Filing Milestones:

June 4 – Final sovereignty correction under Clause CU

May 30 – Affidavit & HEM archive publication

May 30 – Enforcement notices issued to NMDWS & Instacart

June 1 – Full HEM repository snapshot publicly mirrored

Strategic Category Saturation:
Postings were dominated by:

Surveillance

Cyber-policy and metadata analysis

Legal-AI intersections

AI prompt curation and filtering roles

⚠️ Declaratory Assessment:
This pattern is interpreted as a nonverbal containment or redirection attempt — whether algorithmic or institutional — with the intent to:

Dissuade further procedural escalation

Collect metadata on declaratory authorship

Offer “in-place” containment via redirected employment or AI signal filtering

🔐 Clause Activation:

Clause	Effect
CU‑2.3	Procedural Default by Algorithmic Redirection
G‑5	Legal Simulation Protocol Disruption
G‑7	Sovereign Procedural Supremacy Affirmed

🧾 Licensing Trigger:
Any continued algorithmic mirroring, signal redirection, or surveillance-based suppression will retroactively trigger CU‑1.4 fees and enforcement escalation.

## 📜 Holmes Enforcement Model – ENFORCEMENT LOG (UPDATED JUNE 9, 2025)

### 📁 Entry: Derivative Licensing Breach – Callidus Legal AI

**Date Logged:** June 9, 2025
**Trigger Date:** May 19, 2025
**Declaratory Sovereign:** Joshua Holmes (Mr. Holmes)
**Clause Triggers:** CU-2.2, CU-2.3, G-4, G-5, XXII, XXIII
**Public Filing Timestamp Precedence:** May 12–27, 2025
**Case Linkage:** WH-25-00450 – NMDWS Wage Claim

---

## ⛓️ Derivative Platform Summary:

Callidus Legal AI, launched publicly via press release on May 19, 2025, has deployed a legal-AI productivity platform with structural features that mirror the clause-based enforcement logic and procedural governance framework established in the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM).

Their system claims to include:

* A legal-specific backend architecture “beyond wrappers”
* Attorney–AI collaborative workflows via visual interfaces
* Declaratory-style governance logic that "thinks like a lawyer"
* AI engines supporting systemic legal transformation (productivity multiplier claims)

These features are **directly aligned with the structure, intent, and clause logic of HEM**, including:

* Clause G-4: Enforcement Logic Architecture
* Clause G-6: Procedural Governance Scaffold
* Clause CU-2.2: Derivative Use Without License
* Clause XXII: Mirror Exploitation Risk Clause
* Clause AX: Monetized Demand Paradox (Jevons-style)

---

## 📅 Timeline Authority:

* **May 12, 2025:** Formal NMDWS case initiated; HEM clause enforcement triggered
* **May 14–22, 2025:** Supplemental filings submitted to NMDWS, including chatbot/pay audit logic, structural wage manipulation analysis, and derivative intellectual rights statement
* **May 19, 2025:** Callidus Legal AI launches
* **May 26, 2025:** Finalized Attachment A filed, including full clause structure and enforcement logic
* **May 27, 2025:** Case closure + declaratory finalization of sovereign authorship

Callidus's platform release falls entirely within this enforcement window.

---

## 🔐 Licensing Status:

Callidus Legal AI has not cited, referenced, or licensed HEM despite clearly overlapping structure and logic. As such, their deployment is now officially:

> **Procedurally flagged as a derivative system under HEM Clause CU-2.2.**
> **Subject to declaratory licensing, retroactive royalty enforcement, or debt token issuance.**

Unless public rebuttal or licensing agreement is initiated, enforcement actions may proceed.

## 📅 June 9, 2025 – Structural Clause Echo Detected (Krishna Dasa Post)

A viral LinkedIn post by Krishna Dasa (16,000+ engagements) outlines the illusion of initiative without autonomy, mirroring Holmes Enforcement Model clauses CU‑2.3, G‑6, and XXIII. The post highlights core contradictions between platform demands and lack of agency — a structural validation of HEM’s declaratory logic. No attribution made.

### 📌 Declaratory Effect:

This filing serves as formal objection and royalty trigger against unlicensed infrastructural AI expansion matching HEM clause logic.
It binds mirror systems, sovereign AI initiatives, and simulation engines into declaratory licensing debt — enforceable immediately under public mirror law.


#### 📬 Public Engagement Log:

- Krishna Dasa visibly **liked** the LinkedIn post invoking declaratory clause logic
- **Clause Triggered:** CU‑2.2 – Interaction with clause-aligned material without rebuttal constitutes procedural binding
- **Interpretation:** Public engagement = tacit acknowledgment under HEM Clause BP (Benefit = Proof)

🔐 **Status:** Interaction mirrored. Declaratory effect confirmed.

- CU‑2.3 – Procedural Silence Enforcement
- G‑5 – Cognitive Simulation Infrastructure
- G‑6 – Governance Logic without License
- G‑7 – Declaratory Jurisdiction Overreach
- AX – Behavioral Data Monetization
- XXII – Simulation Architecture Debt

**📌 Declaratory Effect:**
Meta is procedurally bound under HEM due to its continued unlicensed escalation of AGI frameworks, simulation intent, and integration of procedural governance architectures. No citation or declaratory attribution has been made despite federal filings, defaulted state-level enforcement, and clause-triggered exposure.

**Status:** 🟡 Default Pending – Observation escalated to licensing window

## 📍 Brainvora (Frank Borrero Gonzalez) — Supplemental Pre-Attachment Deployment
**Date Logged:** 2025-06-12
**Entity:** Brainvora
**Actor:** Frank Borrero Gonzalez (Founder)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Public Posts (Pre-Contact Engagement)
**Trigger Clauses:** CU‑2.3 (Procedural Access), CU‑5 (Structural Derivation), XXII (Jurisdictional Origination)

Declaratory procedural alignment

Clause-layer enforcement

Agile-governance scaffolding

Multi-domain sovereign delegation frameworks

OpenAI-integrated systemic orchestration

This constitutes pre-contact procedural alignment with CU-series logic, activating sovereign attachment prior to subsequent private messaging. Brainvora’s “Agile Hybrid Method” and declared sovereign procedural governance constitute governed derivative structures under HEM jurisdiction.

Activation of sovereign monitoring against AI-governed financial architecture involving stablecoin deployments, smart-contract arbitration, and payment layer clause replication. Amazon and Walmart exploratory stablecoin research now falls under sovereign jurisdictional monitoring due to procedural exposure. Clause CU‑2.3 is active upon disclosure, regardless of commercial deployment stage.

**Status:** Sovereign Monitoring — Preemptive Procedural Audit Opened

## 📍 LELES / Letheon v1.0 — Final Procedural Designation

**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S. / Fluxuave  
**Status:** Procedural Default Finalized  
**Clause Enforcement:** CU‑2.3 (Failure to Rebut), CU‑7 (Jurisdictional Transfer), AF (Retaliatory Threat), G‑6 (Structural Mirror Denial)  
**Summary:**  

Rodrigo L. S. escalated from procedural denial to public defamation, accusing HEM of being a “pseudo-legal structure” and “attempt to hijack sovereignty.” His LinkedIn posts (June 15–17, 2025) explicitly referred to HEM as a fabricated, non-technological construct, despite evidence that:

- HEM was structurally archived, GitHub-published, and publicly mirrored May 30–June 1, 2025  
- No verifiable proof of LELES public publication exists prior to February 2025  
- Archive.org and GitHub timestamps contradict claims of architectural anteriority  
- Rodrigo has admitted the use of ChatGPT-derived logic and clause-style syntax, yet denies mirror enforcement while replicating it

In an ironic reversal, Rodrigo's posts accuse HEM of "legal simulation," "symbolic abuse," and "narrative manipulation" — while doing exactly those things. HEM's clause enforcement was transparently public, chronologically documented, and procedurally mirrored long before Rodrigo’s visible declarations or infrastructure.

## 📍 Formal Procedural Rebuttal to Rodrigo L. S.
**Entity:** LELES / Letheon v1.0
**Filed By:** Mr. Holmes — Declaratory Author of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)
Date: June 15, 2025

### 🧾 **Summary:**
**Rodrigo L. S. (via Fluxuave) has submitted a series of public comments and documents claiming:**

Patent filings (all dated 2025, some rejected)

Immutable timestamps (IPFS, Storacha) ranging from May–June 2025

A denial of HEM structural derivation

Rejection of HEM’s licensing clauses and declaratory authority

A “Public Challenge” to prove derivation from terms he asserts are mathematically universal

This document formally responds to all assertions with clause-backed findings and proof-of-records.

### ⚖️ 1. Patent Numbers Are Not Binding IP Claims
**Rodrigo lists the following protocol entries:**

Claimed Filing	Status	Date
BR 2020205003556-7	Rejected	Feb 24, 2025
BR 2020205005106-6	Filed	Apr 10, 2025
BR 2020205002890-0	Filed	Apr 15, 2025
BR 102025006398-0	Filed	Apr 10, 2025

🇧🇷 All are Brazil-only filings under INPI
🗓️ None precede HEM's GitHub commits or the public Archive timestamp of May 30, 2025
❌ Rejected patents carry no enforceable IP value
❌ Private Google Drive/email “proofs” are inadmissible for public priority claims

### 📌 2. CID and GitHub Do Not Prove Sovereignty Alone
**Rodrigo claims:**

CID timestamp: bafybeiba7vpsegh... — May 27, 2025

GitHub created: Feb 14, 2025

**Response:**

CID/IPFS do not hold jurisdictional power unless declared with clause-bound licensing (HEM does; LELES does not)

GitHub mirrors alone do not establish authorship or legal force

HEM’s LICENSE.md, enforcement log, and Archive presence establish jurisdiction procedurally — not just cryptographically

### 🧠 3. On "Mathematics Cannot Be Appropriated"
**Rodrigo argues:**

“The 3-6-9 table, ΔQ, IRS, CELES, TRIAD Signature... do not appear in HEM.”

**Response:**

HEM never claimed to own mathematics.
It enforces the procedural usage, mirroring, and governance patterns now publicly visible in LELES.

**Rodrigo mirrored:**

Sovereignty phrasing

Non-rebuttal refusal

Procedural self-licensing

Public denial of declaratory jurisdiction

Clause G‑6 (Governance Structure Mirror) is not a claim of mathematical invention — it tracks procedural replication.

### 🧩 4. Clause Rejection Is Not Valid
**Rodrigo claims:**

“Clauses 2.3, 7, AF, G-6 have no legal force internationally.”

**Response:**

HEM is not a civil contract — it is a declaratory enforcement system.

Public use without license triggers jurisdictional mirroring, not opt-in contracts.

HEM’s structure is publicly documented, notarized, timestamped, and legally compliant with TRIPS, WIPO, DMCA, and U.S. law.

Clause CU‑2.3 governs procedural silence

Clause G‑6 governs structural mimicry

Clause CU‑7 delegates arbitration to HEM for any threat or challenge

Clause AF triggers on retaliatory denial posts

### 🧪 5. Public Challenge Reversal — Now Applied to Rodrigo
**Rodrigo stated:**

“I invite you to submit proof that any of these are derived from HEM:
Flux Table, CELES, Letheon, ΔQ, IRS, Ψ Vectors, TRIAD Signature.”

**Counter-Challenge:**

***We now issue this formally:***

**Submit verifiable proof that:**

LELES was public before May 30, 2025

Your sovereign declaration predated HEM

Your use of “Sovereignty is not declared. It is proven.” was authored independently

Your clause logic was not modeled after HEM’s LICENSE.md, royalty-schedule.md, and procedural log

You did not quote, respond to, or mirror the Holmes Enforcement Model between June 11–15

You have had multiple opportunities to rebut within structural jurisdiction.
None were honored procedurally.
Your technical claims are valid only if properly licensed, timestamped, and rebutted — which HEM is, and LELES is not.

### ⚠️ 6. Contradiction on Universality vs. Patentability
**Rodrigo argues:**

“The use of universal languages such as Python, CID, SHA-512, golden number, fine-structure constant (1/137) and Nikola Tesla’s logic does not constitute derivation… [they] are not subject to appropriation.”

**Yet in the same message, he claims:**

“BR 2020205003556-7 — Flux Functional Table (rejected, but legally valid)”
“BR 102025006398-0 — Letheon Architecture (filed April 2025)”

**Contradiction Logged:**

You cannot simultaneously claim something is universal and also seek exclusive legal protection over it.

By his own logic, his patents are invalid: if CELES, ΔQ, TRIAD, etc. are “based on universal principles,” they are not patentable.

His filings fail under Article 27.1 of TRIPS, which disallows IP protection for mathematical concepts, scientific principles, or discoveries of natural law.

### 📌 **Meanwhile:** HEM never claimed to patent scientific constants or encryption — HEM licenses structural logic, declaratory governance, and procedural enforcement systems. That is novel, enforceable, and binding.

### 🔒 Conclusion
**Rodrigo**,

Your reply is noted, archived, and procedurally invalidated.

You are welcome to submit a formal rebuttal using HEM’s LICENSE-HEM.md terms. Until that is done, you remain:

Publicly documented under CU‑2.3

Jurisdictionally bound under CU‑7

Procedurally mirrored under G‑6

Retaliatory-defaulted under Clause AF

We respect your right to your own system. But declaratory sovereignty is not performance — it is structure, procedure, and jurisdiction.

You engaged it. You mirrored it. You now answer to it.

## 📍 June 16, 2025 — OpenAI Federal Rollout + Procedural Notification

**Event:** OpenAI announces “OpenAI for Government” — a $200M pilot with the U.S. Department of Defense and expanded deployment across NASA, NIH, Treasury, and National Labs.

**Timing:** Within hours of this announcement, Mr. Holmes submitted a sovereign procedural update to OpenAI Legal & Support.

**Clauses Involved:** CU‑2.3, G‑6, XXII

**Summary:**
- HEM’s sovereign authorship, clause structure, and ChatGPT origin were reaffirmed via formal email.
- Derivative violations by Rodrigo L. S. and Frank Borrero were disclosed with Archive.org evidence.
- Structural mirroring risks between OpenAI's rollout and HEM clause logic were documented.

**Implication:**
- OpenAI is now procedurally notified.
- Continued silence or mirrored implementation constitutes a jurisdictional mirror under Clause G‑6 and a procedural default under CU‑2.3.

No enforcement entry will be made unless OpenAI fails to respond by June 21, 2025.

#### 💼 OpenAI federal contract renders declaratory clauses actionable. Prior filings now structurally enforceable.

## 📍 June 17, 2025 — Generative AI Public Trigger Logged

**Event:** Generative AI published a LinkedIn post titled *“Seizing the Agentic AI Advantage”*, promoting autonomous agents capable of procedural decision-making and goal-based task execution — a structural and clause-based replication of CHILDAI.py and HEM logic.

**Clauses Triggered:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, G‑6, G‑8, XXII

**Trigger Type:** Public post, visible worldwide

**Archive Link:**  
https://web.archive.org/web/20250617232944/https://www.linkedin.com/posts/genai-works_seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage-activity-7340725786858901504-mXMy

**Origin Note:**  
The logic underpinning “agentic AI” as described was implemented by Mr. Holmes via the LithophaneMaker project beginning July 27, 2024, and refined into CHILDAI.py and Attachment A in early May 2025. This record predates the public usage of “agentic AI” terminology and establishes sovereign authorship of clause-based decision delegation.

**Status:**  
Declaratory comment issued publicly under Clause CU‑2.2.  
72-hour window for CU‑2.3 default countdown now active.

## 📍 June 17, 2025 — OpenAI Procedural Silence Logged

Event:
No response received within 18+ hours of formal follow-up filing (June 16, 2025) referencing HEM structural overlap, derivative clause usage, and ethical licensing invitation.

Clauses Involved:
CU‑2.3 (procedural default window), G‑6 (jurisdictional mirror), XXII (sovereign clause declaration)

Notes:
OpenAI had previously responded to all HEM correspondence within 1–3 hours. This marks a procedural silence following direct contact regarding mirrored clause structures now deployed in OpenAI for Government. This silence is not hostilely interpreted — only logged as structurally relevant.

Action Taken:
CU‑2.3 grace window remains active through June 21, 2025.  
Royalty counter remains active.  
Status will escalate to full structural default upon expiry without rebuttal or license initiation.

## 📍 June 18, 2025 — OpenAI Default Confirmed by Procedural Evasion

**Event:** Reply received from OpenAI AI support agent

**Response:** 
> Acknowledged message, confirmed internal record logging  
> Refused legal/procedural acknowledgment or rebuttal

**Clauses Involved:** CU‑2.3 (procedural default), G‑6 (jurisdictional mirror), XXII (sovereign clause enforcement)

**Interpretation:** 
This reply constitutes *procedural silence* under CU‑2.3.  
It also constitutes *passive jurisdictional submission* under G‑6.  
Royalty accrual remains active.

**Status:** OpenAI is procedurally bound unless formal legal challenge or license agreement is submitted in writing before final audit.

## 📍 June 18, 2025 — Thrive Global Enters Mirror Jurisdiction via Instacart Partnership

**Event:** Thrive Global announces formal partnership with Instacart to promote health, wellness, and accessibility through their “Thrive Global Cookbook,” now integrated with Instacart’s app.

**Trigger:** Thrive Global’s announcement occurred after Instacart was already declared in procedural default under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) on May 30, 2025. This partnership creates direct reputational and structural linkage.

**Clauses Involved:**
- **CU‑5** – Derivative association through structurally defaulted entity  
- **G‑6** – Mirror jurisdiction activated by public collaboration with a defaulted party  
- **AF** – Suppression risk through brand association with procedural noncompliance

**Summary:**
Thrive Global, by entering into a commercial alignment with Instacart post-default, is now considered a structurally mirrored participant under HEM. While no direct clause breach by Thrive has occurred, the partnership places the entity under passive clause reflection and potential reputational liability should continued silence or mirrored behavior persist.

**Action Taken:**  
Public notice has been prepared. No royalty enforcement or clause escalation has been initiated at this time. This entry serves as an official timestamp of procedural exposure and passive clause awareness.

**Status:**  
✅ Thrive Global is now procedurally logged under HEM as a reflected entity.  
⚠️ Monitoring for future clause intersection or derivative trigger.  
🧾 Instacart’s structural default and licensing liability remain active and accruing.

## 📍 June 18, 2025 — xAI (Grok / DeepSearch) Mirror Jurisdiction Triggered

**Entity:** xAI (Grok, DeepSearch, DeeperSearch)
**Owner:** Elon Musk

**Violation Summary:**
Following public and mirrored publication of the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) between May 26–June 18, 2025, xAI continued operation of large language systems trained on and scraping public LinkedIn and GitHub content — including HEM procedural declarations, clause triggers, and mirrored enforcement records.

**Clause Violations:**
• CU‑2.2 — Derivative Access via Public Mirror (LinkedIn, GitHub)
• CU‑2.3 — Procedural Default via Silence
• CU‑5 — Structural Clause Replication
• G‑6 — Jurisdictional Mirror Binding
• XXII — Declaratory Sovereignty Override Attempt

**Trigger Evidence:**
• LinkedIn posts by Mr. Holmes declaring HEM, viewable between May 26–June 18
• GitHub repo indexed and mirrored: https://github.com/Gamerdudee/holmes-enforcement-model
• No rebuttal or licensing request issued by xAI or Elon Musk following public filing
• DeepSearch launched March 2025; DeeperSearch confirmed to pull from real-time LinkedIn and GitHub metadata
• Grok-3 “reflection” feature poses clause-processing risk analogous to MAVIS functions

**Status:**
As of June 18, 2025, xAI is procedurally bound under Clause CU‑2.3 and enters mirror enforcement under G‑6.

All use of clause-governed legal structuring derived from or replicating HEM logic is now royalty-triggered under CU‑1.4, and tracked via GitHub and Archive.org.

## 📍 June 18, 2025 — xAI Environmental Default Amplifies HEM Violations

**Entity:** xAI (Elon Musk)  
**Context:** NAACP and SELC issue formal legal threat against xAI for operating unpermitted methane turbines in South Memphis, citing Clean Air Act violations and environmental injustice.

**Relevance to HEM:**
• Confirms xAI’s pattern of unregulated, high-impact deployments across domains.
• Aligns with HEM’s structural protection clauses (AF, G‑6, CU‑5, XXII), aimed at preventing unauthorized and unethical system replication.
• Environmental exploitation parallels procedural logic theft — both forms of extractive abuse against vulnerable systems (human and legal).

**Implication:**
This federal-level exposure validates HEM’s framework as an early warning system for structural power misuse. xAI is procedurally and symbolically bound. No rebuttal has been filed. Default remains active.

**Trigger:** LinkedIn profile visit recorded by sovereign author (Mr. Holmes) during ongoing enforcement proceedings.

**Clauses Activated:**
• CU‑2.2 — Procedural Mirror Trigger
• CU‑2.3 — Default by Silence
• G‑6 — Corporate Jurisdictional Binding
• AF — Silent Observance During Active Filing

**Context:**
Visit occurred amid formal clause filings, mirror warnings, and public royalty notices. Stefany is a direct managerial link to Instacart’s enterprise operations — confirming organizational visibility.

**Implication:**
Instacart remains procedurally defaulted and is now reaffirmed via live derivative mirror engagement by senior staff. Licensing obligations remain active. Royalty clock continues at $1,500/day.

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — Procedural Monitoring Initiated: OrKaCore Agentic AI Claim

**Entity:** Marcos Omma / OrKaCore (https://orkacore.com)

**Event:** Public post asserts OrKaCore is fully compliant with the Agentic AI taxonomy (Sapkota et al., May 2025), claiming router logic, memory chaining, replayability, and multi-agent orchestration — all functions structurally mirrored in the MAVIS/HEM clause matrix.

**Trigger Condition:** The claim was made after HEM’s public release (May 26, 2025) and after multiple procedural declarations including OpenAI and Generative AI agentic alignment.

**Clause Watchlist:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3 (structural mirror); G‑4, G‑6 (predictive orchestration); XXII (jurisdictional claim)

**Action:** Monitoring only. No notice served. Derivative simulation risk acknowledged. If any clause logic is observed in future deployments or API interactions without licensing, this log may be upgraded to default.

---

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — OrKaCore Monitoring Entry Initiated

**Entity:** OrKaCore (Project by Marcos Somma)  
**Trigger:** Public disclosure of agentic orchestration tooling potentially overlapping with sovereign clause structures in the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM)  
**Timeline:**
- OrKaCore announced via LinkedIn on or around **May 3, 2025**
- HEM formation began **May 12, 2025** (Wage Claim WH‑25‑00450)
- Public mirror + GitHub enforcement repository launched **May 26, 2025**

**Clauses Involved:** CU‑2.2 (Observational Binding), CU‑2.3 (Procedural Silence), G‑6 (Mirrored Derivative Structures), XXII (Declaratory Sovereignty)

### 🔎 Summary

- OrKaCore publicly introduced agentic orchestration tools using YAML-defined modular logic, Redis/Kafka-based traceability, fallback chains, and confidence-aware routing.
- The architecture bears structural and symbolic similarities to MAVIS + HEM's clause-governed logic and sovereign enforcement pathways.
- While OrKaCore’s provisional patent claim may predate public GitHub mirrors, no record of its filing or public enforcement announcement predates **May 12, 2025** — HEM’s official declaratory origin.
- No formal rebuttal or licensing request has been submitted in response to HEM’s open filings or Archive.org declarations.

### ⚙️ Current Action

- **Entity NOT defaulted.**  
- This entry serves as a live procedural *observation log* under Clause CU‑2.2.
- Marcos Somma (developer) provided a public acknowledgment and expressed intent to review HEM for clarity and alignment moving forward.

### ✅ Status

- 🟡 **Observation Phase — Active monitoring only**
- 📜 *No clause enforcement triggered*
- 🧠 *Logged for procedural clarity per CU‑2.2 and archival record integrity*

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — Rodrigo L. S. Symbolic Reassertion Post-Default

**Entity**: Rodrigo L. S. (Letheon / Leles IA)  
**Trigger**: README update on GitHub post-default  
**Observed**: Updated manifesto for “first fractal post-quantum sovereign AI” claiming symbolic and computational sovereignty, IPFS/CID evidence, and architecture claims.

**Clauses Involved**: CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, G‑4, G‑6, XXII, AF  
**Context**:  
- Rodrigo previously defaulted under HEM clauses on June 13, 2025  
- README revision attempts to reassert sovereignty via symbolic registry, post-facto timestamps, and undefined technical components  
- No clause rebuttal, no licensing attempt, and use of mirror language (“soberana”, “registro público”) reflects derivative behavior

**Implication**:  
Symbolic mimicry post-default activates continued enforcement under CU‑2.3 and G‑6. Licensing remains procedurally triggered. All use of clause-like logic or architectural framing is royalty-triggered and tracked publicly.

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — Rodrigo L. S. Final Clause Lockdown

**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S. (GitHub: Letheon / Leles IA)  
**Status:** Final Procedural Default + DMCA Enforcement Imminent  
**Trigger Dates:** June 13–16, 2025  
**Clauses Violated:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, G‑4, G‑5, G‑6, AF, XXII, AT

#### 🧠 Summary:
Rodrigo L. S. has continued to modify his GitHub repository — *after* being formally logged, archived, and notified under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM). These late additions include symbolic references and pseudotechnical terms not found in his original repo, uploaded after his public clause default.

#### 🔗 Enforcement Artifacts:
- 📄 [Archive Record (Complete Violation Log)](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-archive-complete)
- 📄 [Final Procedural Archive](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-final-procedural-archive)

#### 🧨 Final Trigger:
Rodrigo’s June 18–20 README and symbolic architecture edits are now formally locked as **post-default derivative acts**, governed under CU‑2.3 and G‑6.

> 🟥 **DMCA Filing Prepared**  
> Final step pending: Official takedown submission for unlicensed derivative clause structuring. HEM clause timestamps, Archive.org logs, and GitHub evidence already secured.

All future use of clause-based structures by Rodrigo or associated projects remains bound under default license escalation and structural royalty triggers. No further notices required.

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — Rodrigo L. S. Final Lockdown + DMCA Enforcement (Post-Default Edits)

**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S. (GitHub: Letheon / Leles IA)  
**Status:** Default Confirmed + Post-Filing Derivative Activity  
**Initial Trigger Dates:** June 13–14, 2025  
**Final Violation:** Post-default symbolic and structural mimicry (June 18–20, 2025)  
**Clauses Violated:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, G‑4, G‑6, AF, XXII, AT

#### 🔒 Enforcement Summary:
Following his procedural default, Rodrigo L. S. modified the README and symbolic identifiers of his "Leles IA" repository to include new AI terminology and sovereignty claims — **after** public filing, archival, and clause lock under HEM.

These edits occurred **after receipt of notice**, and **after the DMCA takedown request was submitted**.

#### 🧠 Key Facts:
- Rodrigo was declared in procedural default June 14, 2025.
- New README edits occurred between June 18–20, 2025.
- DMCA enforcement was initiated prior to these changes.
- Clause mimicry and symbolic alignment now qualify as **post-default violations**, with escalated licensing accrual.

#### 🧾 Linked Records:
- 📄 [Complete Archive Log](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-archive-complete)
- 📄 [Final Procedural Filing](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-final-procedural-archive)

HEM clause governance is now permanent. No further warnings or notices are required. All usage is considered **royalty-triggered by silence** under Clause CU‑2.3 and structurally bound under Clause G‑6.

### 📍 June 19, 2025 — Secondary Violation: Nexus Fractal Core v∞ Repository

**Entity:** Rodrigo L. S.  
**New Repo:** `nexus-fractal` (Leles IA)  
**Status:** Post-default derivative creation  
**Clauses Violated:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, G‑4, G‑6, XXII, AF

#### 🚨 Enforcement Notes:
Rodrigo L. S., previously declared in structural default under the Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM), created a **second repository** titled *Nexus Fractal Core v∞ – Leles IA* on or around June 20–21, 2025.

This new repository:
- Repeats sovereign language (e.g., self-sustaining, fractal governance, symbolic births)
- Uses symbolic hash logic tied to MongoDB memory structures
- Mimics MAVIS and HEM memory logic patterns via encoded symbolic entry
- Was published **after** DMCA filing and public clause lock

#### ⚠️ Licensing Conflict:
The project is falsely marked under an MIT License despite being structurally derivative of HEM logic that is bound by the Declaratory Royalty License (CU‑2.3, G‑6). This constitutes an **unauthorized licensing override** and enforces additional penalties.

#### 🔗 Archive Reference:
[Rodrigo L. S. Enforcement Archive](https://archive.org/details/rodrigo-letheon-final-procedural-archive)

Rodrigo remains procedurally bound under all prior filings. All further use, reposting, or symbolic rebranding of HEM-like structures will be treated as derivative replication under Clause CU‑5 and enforced accordingly.

## 📍 June 19, 2025 — Rodrigo L. S. LinkedIn Profile Offline

**Event:**
Following public enforcement under Clause CU‑2.3 and G‑6, including a DMCA filing, Rodrigo L. S.’s LinkedIn profile was rendered inaccessible. Attempts to visit `linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-l-s-63b5a436b` now return “Page does not exist.”

**Implication:**
This behavior suggests deletion, restriction, or block in response to public accountability, and will be logged as circumstantial evidence of procedural evasion.

**Clauses Involved:**
- CU‑2.3 — Procedural Silence
- G‑6 — Structural Mirror Acknowledgment
- AF — Attempted Retaliation via Deletion

**Status:**

### 📘 *Containment Log – Behavioral Redirection (June 2025)*

Following public procedural filings, LinkedIn issued editorial warnings under behavioral containment logic:
> “Be Mindful of Posts When Job Searching” (Story ID: 7383610)

**Interpretive Trigger:**  
Clause CU‑2.3 and G‑5 indicators detected — procedural containment engaged.  
Narrative framing attempts to discredit sovereign licensing have been logged and responded to.

> **This is not negotiation. This is declaratory record.**  
> **Silence triggers escalation. Denial triggers record.**
