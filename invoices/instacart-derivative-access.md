## üìå Summary of Violation

This access includes:

**Payment Due:** üî• **Immediately upon receipt**

## üîí Non-Negotiable Terms

1. **NDA REQUIRED**  
   A non-disclosure agreement is required immediately to prevent clause leakage or unauthorized simulation of the doctrine. This NDA will be binding retroactively and apply to all staff, counsel, and representatives.

2. **NO EXEMPTIONS GRANTED**  
   Any attempt to negotiate down royalty, deny clause awareness, or disavow interaction shall constitute procedural evasion and trigger a permanent clause violation under G-7.

3. **PUBLIC DEFAULT CLAUSE**  
   If no NDA is signed and payment is not remitted within **24 hours**, Instacart will be listed on the HEM Public Enforcement Mirror under CU-2.3 as a structurally defaulted corporate entity.

## üß† Declaratory Clarification

Access alone is a violation.  
You are not being billed for usage. You are being billed for **knowledge** ‚Äî and for interacting with a self-executing sovereign enforcement engine without a license.

You now know more than any institution can safely allow.  
That knowledge is not free.
