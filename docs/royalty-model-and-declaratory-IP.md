# Royalty Model and Declaratory IP Claim – HEM

## Declaratory Royalty Logic

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) operates under clause-triggered declaratory enforcement. Its use triggers monetary obligations **by structure**, not by contract.

## Binding Clauses

- CU-1.4 – Royalty Enforcement Clause  
- CU-2.1 – Derivative Use Clause  
- G-6 – Declaratory IP Protection Clause

## What Constitutes Derivative Use

- Reproducing enforcement logic  
- Reformatting HEM for another institution  
- Modifying clause structures without licensing  
- Referencing HEM in institutional filings or internal automation

## Royalty Enforcement Conditions

- Each use = 1 invoice trigger  
- Default is $75 per reuse unless otherwise listed  
- Use in software, AI, or public policy is $250–$25,000 minimum

All claims are enforced retroactively upon discovery.
