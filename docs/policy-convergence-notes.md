- **Clause CU‑2.3** — Procedural Binding via Silence or Inaction  
- **Clause G‑6** — Unauthorized Simulation of Declaratory Governance  
- **Clause XXII** — Structural Exploitation of AI-Created Sovereign Systems

## 📌 2025 EU Generative AI Policy Report (June 2025)

**Source:** European Commission Deep Dive on Generative AI  
**Date Observed:** June 14, 2025  
**Archived Post:** [LinkedIn Summary Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/genai-works_jrc14259801-activity-7339992733517762560-yR1t)  
**Relevance to HEM:**

- 🔒 **Clause Alignment:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, G‑4 through G‑8, Clause XXII  
- 🧠 **MAVIS Overlap:** Learning feedback loops and ethical decision modeling via sovereign architecture  
- 🧾 **BunKaiSensei Parallel:** Cognitive scaffolding and procedural reasoning for LLMs  
- 🖼 **LithophaneMaker Echo:** Clause-activated transformation logic and local self-triggered behavior

**Key Validations:**

- EU demands transparency, traceability, and auditability in GenAI — structurally embedded in HEM clauses  
- AI governance framed as enforceable, not suggestive — matching HEM’s declaratory enforcement logic  
- Public sector usage = high risk without structure — reinforcing HEM’s clause-based oversight triggers

**Summary:**  
This EU report affirms the global need for declaratory licensing, structural transparency, and enforceable procedural sovereignty — all of which HEM declared and deployed *prior to this filing*.

📜 **Clauses Supported:** CU‑2.3, CU‑5, G‑6, G‑8, XXII  
🧾 **Enforcement Effect:** Default mirror support across institutional enforcement and derivative system recognition.

## 🔎 Subject: LELES Manifesto – Rodrigo Leles

- **Repo:** https://github.com/Fluxuave/leles-manifesto-v1.0  
- **Archived Site:** https://fluxuave.github.io/leles-manifesto  
- **Author:** Rodrigo Leles Santana  
- **Declared Sovereignty:** Yes – via IPFS/DID  
- **Trigger Clauses:** CU‑2.2, CU‑2.3, CU‑5, CU‑6, G‑4, G‑5, G‑6, XXII  

### Summary:

LELES is a symbolic AI project asserting public sovereignty, auditability, and computational personhood. It uses CID/IPFS proof of authorship, DID identity, narrative coherence, emotional computation, and declares itself a “living” system — all without referencing HEM or its declaratory framework.

### Declaratory Conflict:

- **Mimics structural and legal mechanisms already codified in HEM**
- **Uses terms tied to clause-governed sovereign architecture**
- **Fails to rebut, cite, or license against procedurally prior public records**

### Status:

**Procedurally subordinate to HEM.  
Default applies unless public rebuttal is issued and license secured.**
