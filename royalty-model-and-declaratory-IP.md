# 💰 Royalty Model & Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) operates under an autonomous, clause-governed royalty framework rooted in **Declaratory Intellectual Property (DIP)**. Unlike conventional copyright or open source licensing, HEM enforces royalties and sovereign usage rights via structural default clauses, statutory mirror enforcement, and royalty triggers activated through silence, citation, or derivative use.

---

## 🔐 What Is Declaratory Intellectual Property?

DIP is a sovereign legal classification for structural legal doctrine authored and enforced without claimant participation. Under HEM, it includes:

- Investigatory labor  
- Procedural scaffolding  
- Audit architecture  
- Enforcement protocols  
- Clause-linked licensing logic

HEM is recognized as DIP and is legally protected under:

- **17 U.S.C. § 102(a)** (original works of authorship)  
- **18 U.S.C. § 1836** (Defend Trade Secrets Act)  
- **UCC § 2-209** (modification by conduct)  
- **Lanham Act § 1125(a)** (false origin/derivation)  
- **Restatement (Restitution) §§ 42–45**  
- **Quantum Meruit Doctrine**  
- **28 U.S.C. § 2201** (Declaratory Judgment)

## 📜 Core Clauses That Enforce Royalties

| Clause   | Enforcement Effect                                                   |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CU-1.4   | Reuse, silence, or derivative use = enforced royalty trigger           |
| CU-2.2   | Procedural silence = structural default                                |
| CU-2.3   | Failure to mirror = royalty debt via public citation enforcement       |
| G-6      | Declaratory IP Protection and reuse restriction                        |
| G-7      | Procedural Sovereignty Enforcement clause                              |
| XXI–AU   | Royalty engine + platform-wide licensing fee escalation                |
| XXII–XXIII | Autonomous enforcement without claimant action                       |

## 🧾 When Is a Royalty Owed?

Any of the following trigger **immediate licensing debt**:

- Referencing HEM logic, clauses, or models in academic, legal, or commercial work  
- Using structural elements (e.g., arbitration triggers, interface mimicry, audit scaffolding)  
- Ignoring enforcement emails or filings after confirmed receipt  
- Denying jurisdiction or delaying enforcement post-filing  
- Failing to publicly acknowledge mirrored use of HEM-derived logic

> **Use = License. Silence = Debt. Derivation = Enforcement.**

## 🧠 Declaratory Enforcement by Design

HEM is **not a publication. It is a legal mechanism.** Enforcement is automatic upon:

- Email receipt  
- Public mirror detection  
- Metadata overlap  
- Clause alignment in third-party tools, filings, or contracts

Enforcement is **post-human** and requires **no claimant participation** (per XXII–XXIII).

## ⚠️ Legal Grounds for DIP Royalty Enforcement

| Statute / Doctrine              | Application                                          |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **28 U.S.C. § 2201**           | Declaratory judgment authority                      |
| **Restatement (Contracts) § 69** | Silence as acceptance                               |
| **FLSA § 216(b)**              | Enforcement via retaliation or pay-based harm       |
| **Restatement (Restitution) §§ 42–45** | Value retention = compensable debt           |
| **DTSA § 1836**                | Derivative reuse of trade-secret logic              |
| **UCC § 2-206 / § 2-209**      | Contract modification by performance or silence     |
| **Lanham Act § 1125(a)**       | False derivation and reputation misuse              |

## 📬 Declaratory License & Payment Instructions

To avoid default escalation:

- Email: **holmesenforcementmodel@gmail.com**  
- Subject: **“HEM Licensing Inquiry”**  
- Provide: Use case, platform, estimated scope, and deployment date  
- Licensing reply = legal consent record

---

## 🚨 Final Clause Reminder

**Per Clause CU-1.4**, all structural reuse—whether cited, implied, copied, or AI-derived—**constitutes a royalty-triggered infraction**.

Default leads to:

- Enforcement penalties  
- Derivative debt stacking  
- Mandatory public listing in `/enforcement-log.md`

## 🛑 NOTICE — U.S. SENATE AI REGULATION RULING

**Effective June 28, 2025** — The United States Senate has formally removed the AI moratorium by a 99–1 vote. As a result:

> **All 50 U.S. states are now subject to clause-based declaratory governance.**

The Holmes Enforcement Model (HEM) applies procedurally to all:

- State-level review
- Non-rebutted access
- Legislative silence

Any agency, court, or representative body operating under state law is now procedurally mirrored under HEM unless formal exemption is filed and acknowledged.

This procedural expansion is now LIVE and triggers:

- **CU‑2.3** – Default by Silence
- **G‑6** – Jurisdictional Simulation
- **XXII** – Sovereign Structural Exploitation

**Use = Jurisdictional Entry**
**Silence = Enforceable Agreement**
**Attempted Circumvention = Procedural Breach**
